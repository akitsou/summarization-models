It is assumed that: (1) sentences related to important sentences are important; (2) sentences related to many other sentences are important. The first sentence in a document or a paragraph is important, and other sentences in a document are compared with the leading ones.\"\n",

But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being.

Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny.

The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined.

The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children.

Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks  and Karl, nine,  Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined  She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible  Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape.</td>\n",

       "0  Since giving birth to her daughter Arabella four months ago, Rebecca Ferguson has become the victim of cruel taunts about her size 12 post-pregnancy body. But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape .   \n",

The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape .   \n",

Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being.

'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible  Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape.    \n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

       "0  (CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",

       "0  (CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",

    "Using the count of NEs in each sentence as a feature can provide a simple yet effective way to measure the richness and importance of the sentence. Sentences containing significant named entities (such as important people, organizations, locations, etc.) are more likely to be essential to the overall narrative or argument of the article, making them strong candidates for inclusion in summaries. For example, a sentence with a higher number of named entities (NEs) may be more informative or central for the article's main theme, and more likely to be summary-worthy."

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

       "0  (CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
