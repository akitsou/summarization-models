(6ddf76d9a7fcdbb060b394970e9558faa819eccc) We 've enjoyed some of the highest temperatures of the year this week . The range starts at £ 31,995 and the Audi can cost as much as £ 50,000 . No matter how good , the new Audi TT still has nothing on the 1999 model . With the sunshine beaming this week and some of the highest temperatures recorded so far this year , what better moment to splash out on the new third - generation Audi TT Roadster . It goes on sale this month .   Just the time to get the roof off on this softtop German sports car , which has established itself as a firm favourite in the 16 years it has been on the road . I drove the fully stocked four - wheel - drive 2 - litre TFSI in S - line quattro trim with 230 bhp , which was adept at whipping around the Cotswolds in style . Sure - footed and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph . CO2 emissions are a fair 154g / km . Supportively cossetting sports seats leave you sitting comfortably at the wheel . A nicely tuned exhaust pipe gives the TT Roadster a most satisfying ' brrrm brrrm ' . You wo n't break the bank at the filling station . Even with the satisfying performance you 'll average 43.5mpg , rising to 52.3mpg when cruising and still managing a respectable 33.6 mpg around town . Great wind - in - the - hair motoring with a top that will come down in ten seconds at speeds of up to 31 mph , and a more streamlined body . It 's easy to make a hands - free phone call with the automatic three - layer fabric hood down because microphones are embedded in the safety belt . Auto - dim LED headlights have been transferred across from the flagship Audi A8 saloon . If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .   Though this version is on an allnew platform , the progression is evolution , not revolution . The car I drove cost well in excess of £ 50,000 . The range starts from £ 31,995 for the 2 - litre TDi Sport in six - speed manual . The optional open - top driving package includes head - level heating to keep your bonce from getting chilly , an electrically operated wind deflector , which stops parky draughts whistling behind your neck , and handily heated super sports seats . No matter how good , nothing will have the jaw - dropping impact on the car market as the original Audi TT of 1999 . It was dubbed the ' Bauhaus Bullet ' because of its clean , minimalist lines reminiscent of the German art movement of the Twenties and early Thirties . Hefty prestige price tag . The base price of the car I drove was £ 41,630 . But it was loaded up with extras adding another £ 13,000 — or the price of a half - decent family runaround .

(cbed2a778a5e17d729c6e5ee5691b88710620dd7) This 4x4 from Russia is a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover . Off - road , the Niva is in its element , with low and highrange gears . But , forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills - free zone . A highly capable , ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover . It 's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd , with high suspension , pressed steel wheels , Soviet - style looks and real rarity value . Expect to get gawped at : someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out . Always fun . Now available in the UK from Niva imports through its dealer , BB Motors , in Corby , Northamptonshire . On the road , the basic 1.7 - litre petrol engine   is deafeningly noisy , but tolerably smooth . Power steering , manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run . The seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors , all - round visibility is good . Top speed is 91 mph . Off - road , the Niva is in its element , with low and highrange gears , differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction .   It is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big - name utility 4x4s , with 220 mm ground clearance , a 600 mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent . Tall , slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky . You wo n't have to agonise over pages of extras ... they 're more or less nonexistent . This is a very basic utility vehicle , after all . Choose in white , blue , green or red , then decide whether you 'd like the snorkel or snow plough   attachments . An LPG option is available for an extra £ 999 — but you lose boot space . Reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure — once you 've explained exactly what it is . Meets Euro 5 emissions standards . The heated blower , presumably designed with Siberia in mind , has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings . Also available in a compact van format . Spartan on the inside . Forget luxuries such as radios , cup - holders , central locking and electric windows — the Niva is an unabashed frills - free zone .   The upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud , and there 's not much to break or go wrong . There are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot . Do n't trust the petrol gauge , which regularly aims to deceive . No warranty is offered as standard — although a two - year plan is coming soon — and spares may need to be imported . Only available in lefthand drive — unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them !  Shhhh ! You did n't hear it from me . But patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big play of driving a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine .

(3815f10f7a7df0067d9ef27fb9e68d1803a615d0) This is the   final week of our major Good Health series on dementia . We turn our attention to carers and what can be done to make life easier . In England there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone . We explain what to if they become anxious as the light starts to fade . Bed and getting - up times . When to take medication . Meal times . Shopping days . Leisure time such as TV , radio or social times . Before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get the person with dementia to focus on you . There can be a tendency for them to look away and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation . Be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process . For example , if they 're upset do n't ask what 's wrong as they may not know , or are unable to put it into words . Instead , tell them : ' You seem to be upset ; let 's think how we can make you feel better . '  Finishing sentences for them can increase frustration . It 's better to ask if they 'd like you to find words for them if they 're having difficulty . Watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling . For example , repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared , while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed . If they 're doing something obviously wrong , for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard , do n't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration .

(613e86fb4098c7bb4058aa17f5db4b5e4a1a3506) This is the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia . We look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems . For example , we need just as much sleep as we get older . The problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep . When the short - term memory starts to go , it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day , such as whether they 've had breakfast , or showered , or spoken to someone . It can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day . Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes , which can help slow down future decline . Create a memory hub - that is , a central place in the home , perhaps the dining room table or a desk , where important notes , car keys , house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept . Put things here that you want to be able to find quickly . Get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home . Get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week . Things that get done can be ticked off . It is another way to show what has been done , but also shows what remains to be done . Label doors , drawers , cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where . Have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your GP and other care professionals , carers , family and reliable friends . Have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day 's date . When showering or having a bath , establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed . For example , move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you 've used them . Eat regular meals . While other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere , the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood . That 's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning , cognition and memory . In the early stages of dementia , begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person 's life and who people are . It 's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together . Include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry .
