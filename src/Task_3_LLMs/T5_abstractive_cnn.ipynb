David Davis hit out after the Met published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked. The Met also identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘topple’ the Tory government. And it released new CCTV footage, of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer Toby Rowland and then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012. Scroll down for video.  CCTV footage of the plebgate row shows a passer-by watching as the then Tory chief whip attempts to cycle out of the main gates of Downing Street.  The new material - released by Scotland Yard from its investigation into the Plebgate affair 'dubbed Operation Alice' - shows the witness stopping to watch the confrontation.  The witness turns back on himself after seeing Mr Mitchell told by police officers to wheel his bike through the side entrance.  Previously-unseen CCTV images of the Plebgate row reveal that a passer-by witnessed the confrontation between police and Mr Mitchell. The man, who is clearly seen following the exchange, has never been traced. Today’s CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside. In the original police account, several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘visibly shocked’. A Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 challenged this with images obtained from CCTV shot from within Downing Street. But today's separate CCTV footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row. At least one appeared to be listening to the exchange. PC Rowland alleges Mr Mitchell called police officers ‘****ing plebs’ during their exchange. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’ but has apologised for swearing. Tory MPs and supporters of Mr Mitchell said that, despite the report being a ‘police report into the police’, it still showed dishonesty by officers working in Downing Street. They said serious questions must now be asked about whether the Diplomatic Protection Group in charge of guarding No. 10 was fit for purpose. Mr Davis, a former shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘What we have got here is evidence of industrial-scale dishonesty. There was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies. This involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected Government. ‘Despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds, it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point’. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up Andrew Mitchell. ‘It’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect Downing Street saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister. It’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police.’ Further details were also revealed of how a policewoman on duty in Downing Street on the night of the Plebgate incident texted a colleague two days later to say she could bring down the Government. WPC Gillian Weatherley saw, but did not hear, what happened between Mr Mitchell and PC Rowland. In the text, which had grammatical errors and was sent on September 21, 2012, to a colleague referred to as Officer 18, Weatherley wrote: ‘This will make you feel better, I’m the officer that stopped the chief whip leaving Downing St in Wednesday. He didn’t swear at me but Toby that let him out the side gate. I could topple the Tory government x.’ At a misconduct hearing, Weatherley said she had known the recipient of her text for more than 20 years and the message was just ‘banter’.But a month later, on October 21, a text message was sent from her phone number to a neighbour called Nick. It read: ‘Not today but I’m at the front gates tomorrow so I still have time to bring the government down…’ Weatherley lost her job after she failed to provide an honest account of her role in the handling of an email by PC Rowland that described the incident. She denied having passed on PC Rowland’s email when she had in fact sent a picture of the email to a colleague. This was passed to a newspaper. Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main Downing Street gates.  CCTV footage shot from within Downing Street and published by Channel 4's Dispatches programme was held up by Mr Mitchell's allies as proof that there was no sign of any passers-by said to have overheard him rowing with police.  In April, two of the most senior officials in the scandal-hit Police Federation quit – days after the Daily Mail revealed that the union, unhappy about proposed cutbacks, had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government in the run up to Plebgate. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan, who led the inquiry into Plebgate – codenamed Operation Alice – said: ‘We understand the public interest in this case, which is why we have taken the unusual step of publishing this material. ‘Ultimately four police officers have been dismissed from the Met, one of whom was sent to prison. Every serving police officer has cause to feel let down by those colleagues who fall below the standards we all strive to uphold.’ The report also unearthed details of Mr Mitchell’s previous altercations with police in Downing Street. A former head of security and business continuity at No 10, who is not named, said there were two incidents dating back to 2011 when the Tory MP swore about not being allowed through a rear entrance. Mr Mitchell is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions over Plebgate. He is suing the Sun newspaper over its original report about his row with PC Rowland, who, in turn, is suing Mr Mitchell over comments he made at a press conference last year. The case is due before the courts in November. PC Rowland is being backed by the wealthy Police Federation. Critics say the police should not be able to bring civil suits against members of the public, because it could stop them challenging an officer’s version of events.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Fresh evidence published today from police investigation into Plebgate. \n","Tory MP Andrew Mitchell accused of calling police officers 'f****** plebs'\n","Former chief whip admitted swearing but denied using the word 'pleb'\n","Scotland Yard today admitted police 'conspired' to undermine Mr Mitchell. \n","Never-seen-before CCTV footage of the 2012 incident also released today. \n","Video shows witness stopping to watch row between police and Mr Mitchell. \n","Mystery witness has not been traced and could hold key to what happened. \n","===========================================================================================================\n","\n","\n","Original Text : \n","Anyone who has shelled out for an expensive phone lives in fear of dropping it. Now the world's 'most resilient screen protector' has gone on sale, capable of surviving being hit by a hammer. During tests, the transparent screen, which is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, also remained undamaged when dropped while walking on tarmac, bricks and concrete, its manufacturer claims. Called Rhino Shield, the protector is made from a custom-formulated polymer and can absorb five times the impact energy of Gorilla Glass - the glass currently used on iPhone and Samsung screens, for example. Scroll down for video.  The Rhino Shield screen protector, pictured here on the iPhone 5, costs £17.99 and can absorb up to five times the force of Gorilla Glass, currently used on iPhones and other phones. During tests it was also able to withstand being dropped on bricks and tarmac.  Even a 255g steel ball dropping from 48cm failed to scratch the screen and left the phone 'fully usable.' Made by Cambridge-based Evolutive Labs, the sheet can be fitted to the iPhone 5, 5S and 5C and does not affect the touchscreen's sensitivity. The screen comes with a self-adhesive silicone back and as the user wipes a cloth along the front of the film, it clings to the phone's screen, but can be removed if necessary. Its makers claim the Rhino Shield leaves 'no sticky residue or air bubbles' and uses what's called an oleophobic coating that makes it 'smudge proof'; meaning fingerprints don't stick to it. An iPhone 4 version of the scratch resistant screen will be available soon, with other models expected in the future. Rhino Shield was funded by a Kickstarter campaign that ended in March this year and it is now on sale from Firebox for £17.99. The makers explained on the campaign page: 'Protecting mobile devices have been a big challenge. The Rhino Shield sheet, pictured, is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, around 0.029cm, and has a 95 per cent transparency rating. Its makers Evolutive Labs claim that it doesn't affect the phone's touchscreen.  The Rhino Shield also comes with an oleophobic coating making it resistant to smudges and fingerprints.  'There are many great cases that already tackle some of the problems with outstanding solutions and we have seen some protection at insane levels, i.e. cases that enable smart devices to survive when a car runs over it. 'However, there are very few products that attempt to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone - its screen. 'Therefore we were determined to design and engineer a screen protector that will be resistant to impacts. After a year of relentless research and development, the end product is Rhino Shield.' The phone protector goes on sale as SquareTrade, a provider of protection plans for gadgets, tested five smartphones, including Apple's new iPhones, to see if they could withstand drops, dunks and other common hazards. Its found that while the iPhone 5C and 5S scored similar on the 'Breakability' scale, the latest models aren't as durable as last year's iPhone 5. The biggest loser, however, was Samsung's Galaxy S4, which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground, according to San Francisco-based SquareTrade. The phone that withstood SquareTrade's torture test best was Google's Moto X. New research by SquareTrade reveals that the iPhone 5s & 5c were outshone by their predecessor, the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S4.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","The transparent Rhino Shield protector is as thick as three sheets of paper. \n","It can absorb up to five times the impact energy than current Gorilla Glass. \n","The sheet was undamaged even after being dropped on bricks and tarmac. \n","Rhino Shield does not affect a phone's touchscreen sensitivity. \n","===========================================================================================================\n","\n","\n","Original Text : \n","Jenna Miscavige left the church in 2000 and praises Leah for getting out for the sake of her young daughter.  She says the church would usually try to 'smear' defectors but is now 'struggling' She has told of her traumatic childhood amid the murky realms of Scientology – prompting her to flee the church when she was 20. And today the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige has revealed he will be extremely unhappy by the departure of King of Queens star Leah Remini – as it is ‘definitely not good PR’ for the organisation – adding: ‘PR for the most part is all they care about.’ Jenna Miscavige, an outspoken critic of the religion – having once dubbed her uncle David ‘evil’ - told MailOnline: ‘I’m really happy for Leah. I think it took a lot of courage on her part to do this so publically. It's fantastic.' Happy, now: Jenna Miscavige, the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige, seen here with her young son Archie and husband Dallas, today said it was 'fantastic' news that Leah Remini had quit the Church.  Kept from her parents: Jenna Miscavige has told how she was parted from her parents when she was just 12.  Speaking exclusively, Jenna, 29, a third-generation Scientologist who left the organisation when she when she was 20 in 2005, added: 'It’s fantastic that she got out – but to me, the best part is that she has a young daughter and it’s great she won’t have to be brought up in the church. ‘Scientology definitely does use.  families in order to get people to do what they want them to do, they.  know people care and love for their families. ‘So if they have to use the threat of possibly losing them in order to get them to tow the line they’ll do it.’ 'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda' Jenna.  said she had met Leah once, and when asked how her uncle would take the.  news of her departure, she replied: ‘I’m guessing not very well! ‘There are so many things going on for the church right now and this is just another thing. ‘It’s definitely not good PR for them – and PR , for the most part is all they care about.' The daughter of Elizabeth and Ron Miscavige, Jr. Jenna was subjected to a childhood in the teachings of Scientology - and was separated from her parents from the age of 12. Now a happily married.  mother-of-two living in San Diego, California, with her husband Dallas.  and their two children three-year-old Archie and 13-month-old daughter.  Winnie, Jenna said: ‘I think Leah’s brave, I’m really happy for her. 'The Church is all about influence and control and defectors definitely don’t help that agenda. ‘I.  can imagine it’s been very stressful for Leah. But the Church is.  struggling – in the past they would smear defectors and say bad things.  about them, now people know these tactics. Troubled: Jenna Miscavige released a book on being brought up in Scientology earlier this year. She managed to finally leave the church when she was 20. ‘I think more recently they’ve got stuck in a weird place where they think ‘do we smear them or do we not?’ ‘I do think now it’s easier than ever to leave. It’s.  becoming easier and easier to become vocal about the church, and look.  at the all celebrities leaving like Lisa Marie Presley, Katie Holmes and.  Paul Haggis. ‘All those people leaving makes it easier for Leah to go too. Good for Leah.’ At the age of seven, Jenna was admitted to the Sea Organisation, the branch of Scientology's most dedicated followers - and was forced to sign a billion-year contract that bound her immortal spirit  and Class Six Auditor, her stepfather, who is Operating Thetan Level Seven. TV star: Leah Remini made her name starring opposite Kevin James in sitcom King of Queens.  However her parents and sisters are standing by her and have promised not to let the family break apart. However, Jenna says she is still banned from contacting the friends she grew up with, saying: ‘I have new friends now, and I still miss the people who I grew up with.'

Manchester United will have to wear Nike kit during their summer US tour , despite their new adidas deal.  Wayne Rooney and co are expected to jet across the Atlantic in July but will have to wear their old kit.  adidas are the new sponsors in a £750million deal but there is no buy-out clause in Nike deal that ends in July.  Ryan Giggs is pictured in an adidas shirt, the Barclays Premier League side last wore adidas shirts in 1992.  That means that unless United remain in America until August 1 - a week before the start of the season - fans will have to wait to see the new kit while their team continues in what will effectively be an old ensemble. As reported on Wednesday, the tour will be shorter than last year's epic trek across the country and is likely to be confined to the west coast thanks to input from manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman, who pays ferocious attention to detail, vowed that a repeat of last summer would not happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Louis van Gaal has had a big input on United's pre-season plans, restricting the US tour to just 12 days.  Van Gaal believes the extensive tour last year hampered United and it will now be restricted to the west coast.  United traditionally stage a pre-season friendly at Old Trafford and August 1 would seem a logical choice.

Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the £1million race. But the champion trainer  said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered. Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree, will travel to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled at Culloty’s County Cork stable on Friday. Nicholls said: ‘I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. ‘I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say \"sorry mate, he is not running\" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. ‘I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don’t want to run unless I am really happy. ‘I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.’ Spring Heeled  wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year.  Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season’s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree  as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National.  McNamara said: ‘It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.’ With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe’s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights. Luke Morris became the first jockey to ride 100 winners during an All Weather Flat racing season when a double at Chelmsford on Wednesday aboard Giantouch and Middle East Pearl carried him to 101 successes for the campaign.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Nick Scholfield is lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Grand National. \n","The famous race takes place at Aintree on April 11. \n","Scholfield travels to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled on Friday. \n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week.

The pass the parcel of the Championship top spot continued as Bournemouth could only draw after falling behind to an early Freddie Sears goal. They dominated the match, but had to wait until the 82nd minute for Jones, taken on loan from Cardiff 10 days ago, to power in a header. Kenwyne Jones  celebrates acrobatically after levelling for Bournemouth against Ipswich.  Bournemouth's players mob Jones after he earned them a point from the game against Ipswich.  Freddie Sears celebrates putting Ipswich ahead against Bournemouth at Portman Road after six minutes.  Sears  converted from close range to put Ipswich ahead in the early exchanges of the game.  Bournemouth : Boruc; Francis, Cook , Elphick, Daniels; Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Fraser ; Pitman , Wilson. Subs not used: Camp, Ward, Gosling, MacDonald. Manager: Eddie Howe.  Booked: Arter.  Goal: Jones, 82.  Ipswich : Bialkowski; Chambers, Smith, Berra, Fryers; Skuse, Tabb, Bishop ; Varney , Sears , Murphy. Subs not used: Gerken,, Anderson, Williams, McGoldrick. Manager: Mick McCarthy.  Booked: Chambers.  Goal: Sears, 6.  Referee: Robert Madley.  Attendance: 22,672.  ‘We scored an un-Bournemouth goal,’ manager Eddie Howe admitted afterwards. ‘But it was equally effective as any, from a set piece. It’s good to see, we haven’t come back from being behind much this season. ‘Jones is a presence, but he’s more than that he’s got good feet, he was excellent when he came on. He’s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in. That’s when he’s probably going to play his biggest part. It’s his job to turn those into points for us. He could be invaluable.’ All it took was a split second lapse in concentration from Bournemouth’s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute. The first half was still taking shape when Daryl Murphy was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into Sears to fire in first-time. The striker, formerly of West Ham, was so free he looked over to the linesman, fearing he was offside, but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign. Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was diving left, right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead. Twice he denied Ryan Fraser and again a powerful effort from Matt Ritchie. But Jones was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet Ritchie’s left-hand side corner to finally beat the Polish keeper. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy said: ’They put a very, very, very expensive acquisition on. He is pretty good in the air. I’ve just watched it and Tommy Smith is head-to-head with him, it’s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it doesn’t. He’s started to pay a bit back, I’d say.’ Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy shakes hands with Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe before the game.  Bournemouth defender Steve Cook clears the ball under pressure from Ipswich forward Sears.  Cook  of Bournemouth contests a header with Ipswich attacker Daryl Murphy.  Bialkowski pulled off his save of the match in stoppage time, making a one-handed stop at full-stretch to reach substitute Yann Kermorgant’s header from another Ritchie corner. Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, but no-one is able to get a grip at the top of the Championship table. ‘I’ve not known a league change hands so much,’ Howe added. ‘I’ve not known it so tight. It’s crazy. I said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns. ‘I think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away. With so few games to go now it looks unlikely. It all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what’s at stake.’\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Freddie Sears put Ipswich ahead from close range after six minutes. \n","Mick McCarthy's side had the lead at the half-time interval. \n","Kenwyne Jones equalised with a header on his Bournemouth debut. \n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","Kenwyne Jones scored his first goal of the season against Ipswich.

Anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mirón have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth. Discovered in an elaborate grave in the El Mirón cave in Cantabria, Spain, the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40-year-old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago. The images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi  and bolete fungi  that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the Red Lady of El Mirón's teeth.  The study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious Red Lady. Her body was found in 2010 in the cave stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers with an engraved stone nearby. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. Her robust skeleton, which bore few signs of disease, and her elaborate funeral suggests she may have been of high status or even buried in a sacrificial ritual. Now the research looking at the dental calculus - hardened plaque - has helped to shed some light on her diet. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen, fungi and animals. They found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped, bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the Agaric group. The researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay, suggesting she ate few carbohydrates. Robert Power, who led the research, said: 'These types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants from different environments, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'This finding at El Mirón Cave could be the earliest indication of human mushroom use or consumption, which until this point has been unidentified in the Palaeolithic.' Agaric muchrooms include the distinctive red and white spotted fly agaric, which is poisonous but also has halucinogenic qualities. However, the group includes many common forms of mushroom that are harmless. Bolete mushrooms include Boletus edulis, which is also called porchini. There is some evidence from neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Piedmont in the Italian Alps that suggest psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of El Mirón Cave, which lies between Santander and Bilbao. This plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the Red Lady of El Mirón.  The Red Lady was discovered in the El Mirón Cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996.  Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre  is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings but the Red Lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered.  After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal which as has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. The entrance to the El Mirón Cave  is located in the mountainous region of eastern Cantabria in Spain.  The Red Lady was found in an elaborate grave  and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago.  Anthropologists who have studied the Red Lady's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block.  The fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. A primative tombstone found nearby also hints at this. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. There is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet. Mr Power and Dr Amanda Henry, whose work is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined samples of the plaque from the Red Lady's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her. They found chemical signitures that indicate she may have eaten seeds, roots and other plants with low levels of starch. The Fly agaric  is one of the most easily recognised  gill mushrooms which formed the Red Lady's diet.  The researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi. It is possible the fungi had been used to help flavour food or as a medicine. The Tryolean Iceman 'Otzi' - who lived around 3,000 years ago - was found to be carrying several types of fungi. Writing in the journal, Mr Power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the Red Lady. They said: 'The types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants, including seeds and underground storage organs, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'These findings suggest that plant and plant-like foods were parts of her diet, supplementing staples derived from animal foods.' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft  above sea level and the inside is around 100ft  deep, 52ft.  Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Anthropologists studied the teeth of a prehistoric woman nicknamed the Red Lady who was found in the El Mirón cave in eastern Cantabria, Spain. \n","The plaque showed signs of plant pollen and several mushroom spores. \n","It is the earliest evidence for humans eating mushrooms yet discovered. \n","Researchers say the mushrooms may have flavoured the Red Lady's diet. \n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth.

It might prove to be a stunning oversight on Wenger’s part, having pulled out of a deal to sign the 24-year-old from Lille. Talks got to such an advanced stage that Hazard’s agent discussed the move with Wenger in the Arsenal manager’s house, but the Frenchman ultimately ruled he could not compete financially with Chelsea, who landed this season’s standout player for £32million. Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32million in 2012, an amount Arsenal could not afford to fork out.  Hazard, who has had a standout season for Chelsea, even discussed terms in Arsene Wenger's house.  Belgium star Hazard joined Chelsea in May 2012 after impressing in Ligue 1 for French side Lille.  That is looking like a tremendous bargain as Chelsea close in on the title, but Wenger said: ‘I have no big regrets because - at the time - there was so much financially, so much money involved we could not afford it. And  not defend it, honestly. ‘It was linked with all the environment. It was not feasible for us financially.’ Hazard is the frontrunner to be named player of the season after a stunning campaign. Going into Sunday’s clash at Arsenal, he has scored 18 and assisted 10 goals in only 43 starts. Wenger believes the gong will be a shootout between Hazard and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. He said: ‘It’s very close. Let’s not forget that for Eden Hazard it is not the first season but for Alexis Sanchez it is. So he will give him a fight and if Alexis doesn’t make it this year, he will give him a fight as well for next season. ‘I think everybody would agree Hazard had a great season. He has found maturity that he did not have before. I believe his final ball is better, his personality on the pitch is stronger, the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before. ‘He can turn games when it’s 0-0 and when it’s tight. That’s always a sign of top quality.’ Wenger insists that his forward Alexis Sanchez  will run Hazard close in the Player of the Year vote.

Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day  was full of blunders.  Guests at the couple's  wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid.  Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates  as the first two were riddled with errors.  The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony  and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors.  However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh  passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year.  Mrs Haigh  said her new husband  was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day.  Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said \"we all make mistakes and we are only human\". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House   in the city centre, where the pair said their vows.  The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Geoff Haigh, 61, wanted to marry partner Heather after cancer diagnosis. \n","Couple married at Manchester register office but day was full of blunders. \n","Guests forced to listen to wedding song 10 times in a row and venue dirty. \n","Marriage certificate had spelling errors and wrong date and names. \n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","Geoff Haigh, 61, was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer last year.

Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew’s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be ‘struck from the record’. Scroll down for video.  Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record.  Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein.  The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts’s allegations, but issued an order that the ‘lurid’ and ‘unnecessary’ claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. ‘At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,’ he wrote. ‘These unnecessary details shall be stricken.’ Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 – below the age of consent in Florida – were described as ‘immaterial and impertinent’. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as ‘Jane Doe 3’ in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore ‘unnecessary’ for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 – a claim he emphatically denies – and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team’s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was ‘refused’ by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 – in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew’s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince’s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson £15,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court.

And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall. .. They  will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished. .. they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors.

The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer.  Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon.  Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham.  Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City.  Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer.  Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision.  Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can.'\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Inter Milan are keen to sign Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure. \n","The Ivorian is open to a move if the right challenge presents itself. \n","Toure insists that he will not remain at City just to pick up his wages. \n","The 31-year-old could be sold by City as they look to reshape their squad. \n","READ: Manuel Pellegrini is 'weak', says Yaya Toure's agent. \n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","Yaya Toure has admitted he is open to 'new challenges' at Manchester City.
