       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids . The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year . For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year . Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor .   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids . The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year . For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year . Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor .   \n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden.

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids . The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year . For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year . Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor .   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video.  Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.  On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland.  Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year.  Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year.  Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids.  The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu.  Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year.  For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year.  Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor.    \n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids . The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year . For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year . Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor .   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids . The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year . For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year . Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor .   \n",

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n",
       "1  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video.  Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.  On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland.  Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year.  Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year.  Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids.  The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu.  Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year.  For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year.  Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor.    \n",
