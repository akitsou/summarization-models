been a frustrating one and admits he doesn't know what he would do if he scored against boyhood club Chelsea on Saturday. Shaw joined United last summer in a £31.5million transfer from Southampton after an impressive campaign on the south coast, which resulted in him playing for England at the World Cup. However, injuries have plagued the 19-year-old's start to life at Old Trafford with the defender picking up his latest fitness setback during United's 2-1 FA Cup sixth-round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Luke Shaw admits he has endured a 'frustrating' debut season at Manchester United giving himself a 'C-' The 19-year-old's campaign has been beset by injuries since joining from Southampton last summer . Shaw (second left) is back  training with United after missing their last five Premier League games . In total, Shaw has only made 17 appearances in all competitions - a figure he admits is less than satisfactory. “It’s been a frustrating one because of the injuries I’ve picked up but I’m loving it,' he told Match of the Day magazine in an exclusive interview. 'If I was to write a school report on my first season here I’d give myself a C-. You don’t realise just how big Man United is until you’re actually here – it’s frightening! It is the biggest club around.' Despite an injury-plagued beginning under Louis van Gaal, when fit Shaw describes himself as 'lucky' to be playing alongside players such as captain Wayne Rooney and record-signing Angel di Maria. Shaw (right) has made only made 17 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils at present . Shaw last appearance for United came in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month . Shaw was speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine - on sale between April 14-20 . 'I’m playing with the likes of Wayne Rooney, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao and it’s weird because my friends always talk about them, saying how good they are and I’m just thinking “Wow, I play with them!” I’m probably one of the luckiest 19-year-olds to be alive,' he added. Shaw missed United's 4-2 demolition of Manchester City on Sunday as he continues to recover from the injury picked up on FA Cup duty against Arsenal. United's No 3 was back in training prior to the Manchester derby as the Red Devils moved four points clear of their rivals in third place in the Premier League. Van Gaal's men are now looking to record their seventh league win in a row when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday evening. And Shaw, who grew up supporting Chelsea, is hoping to play a part in that fixture - adding that it is his favourite away ground to play at. 'I used to watch Chelsea every week. It was really good when I got to play at Stamford Bridge, I would say that’s my favourite away stadium to go to. Chelsea is one of the first games I look for when the new fixtures come out. 'I haven’t scored yet so I don’t know. If my first goal was to come against Chelsea I’m not sure what I’d do.' Shaw is relishing the prospect of facing boyhood club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening .

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.   \n","\n","

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    internet-free_high  \n","2413  Luke Shaw has made just 17 appearances for Manchester United .\\nShaw joined  United from Southampton last summer .\\nThe 19-year-old's start at Old Trafford has been beset by injury problems .\\nUnited travel to Premier League leaders Chelsea on Saturday evening .\\nLuke Shaw: United players pranked Ashley Young after bird poo incident .  \n","9635                                 Our houses are overtaken with dust mites, leading to winter illnesses .\\nWe shed 50g every week in dead skin, mostly in our bed .\\nDust mites feed off dead human and animal skin and multiply .\\nThey leave Australians with cold or flu-like symptoms .\\nScientists recommend a weekly wash of our bed sheets .

'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.</td>\n","      <td>Our houses are overtaken with dust mites, leading to winter illnesses .\\nWe shed 50g every week in dead skin, mostly in our bed .\\nDust mites feed off dead human and animal skin and multiply .\\nThey leave Australians with cold or flu-like symptoms .\\nScientists recommend a weekly wash of our bed sheets .</td>\n","      <td>70d9d7870cbcd0040db12628b3b5e73707e521fa</td>\n","      <td>With summer well and truly over, it's inevitable allergy and flu season is upon us and there's no escaping the nasty germs in the air. But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses.

but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","213962  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu .

not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","213962  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu .

Scroll down for video.  Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.  On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland.  Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year.  Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&amp;Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year.  Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids.  The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&amp;Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu.  Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year.  For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year.  Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor.</td>\n","      <td>Several pubs and restaurants made the cut in the guide's 2015 edition. \\nThe Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won Pub-With-Rooms of the Year title. \\nCesar Awards also handed out for top newcomer, best country house.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-fc7cf953-b55a-451d-964f-11f52f78a8e5')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-fc7cf953-b55a-451d-964f-11f52f78a8e5 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

                          (CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","213962  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu .

not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","213962  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu .

since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","213962  Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video.  Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year.  On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland.  Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year.  Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year.  Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids.  The Pear Tree at Purton was rated the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ Nine other Cesar Awards were handed out. ‘Unstuffy and impeccable’ Lords of the Manor at Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, won Country House Hotel of the Year, while The Pear Tree at Purton in Purton, Wiltshire, was the top country hotel thanks to its ‘dynamic mother-and-daughter duo’ and ‘superb cuisine’. For families, Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was rated the top place to take the kids. It served as the inspiration for Toad’s stately home in The Wind in the Willows. With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu.  Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year.  For four-legged guests: 'Dogs are treated like people' at Overwater Hall, voted Dog-Friendly Hotel of the Year.  Beautiful garden: The title of Country House Hotel of the Year was awarded to Lords of the Manor.    \n","\n","

was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n","      <td>Lukas Podolski scores his first goal since returning to Cologne in 2-1 defeat .\\nJefferson Farfan and Levan Kobiashvili scored the goals that gave Schalke win .\\nThe defeat leaves Cologne on bottom of the Bundesliga table after five games .</td>\n","      <td>ac2e59e27564f0c77b03513cdea6616d8dd8361d</td>\n","      <td>(CNN) -- Lukas Podolski scored his first goal since returning to Cologne but it was not enough as they crashed to a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga.
