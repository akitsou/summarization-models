a defeat 2-1 against Schalke which leaves them bottom of the German Bundesliga. Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.   \n","1

getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide.

'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year .

With no signals for television, radio or wifi, Scotland's Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station was named Newcomer of the Year. Co-editors Adam Raphael and Desmond Balmer said in a statement: ‘Our choices reflect the changing face of hospitality. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are listed alongside simple B&Bs, as well as many full-service hotels.’ They said: ‘Hotels should be better than home. A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given. 'Finally, the guest may not always be right, but they should always come first.’ Milebrook House, the Welsh Hotel of the Year, is a three-generation-run establishment with a 'well-varied' menu . Cosy: Yalbury Cottage at Lower Bockhampton, Dorset, is Britain's Small Hotel of the Year .

Ride-sharing company Lyft is getting a facelift in the form of a haircut. The San Francisco-based firm has ditched its iconic 3ft-wide fluffy pink mustaches. Instead, the easy-to-spot decoration adorning the front grilles of Lyft cars has been replaced with a 5in-long plastic replica which goes on the dashboard. The new mascots light up so customers can differentiate Lyft vehicles at night. All gone: Ride-sharing company Lyft  has ditched its iconic 3ft-wide fluffy pink mustache logo . Sleeker look: Lyft co-founder John Zimmer displays his company's new mascot - a 5in-long plastic replica of the original fluffy mustache which goes on the dashboard . About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday. Commenting on the haircut, a representative for Lyft said: 'The new glowstache marks an exciting moment for Lyft as we embark on the next chapter of our growth. 'We’ll begin rolling the glowstache out to Lyft drivers across the country in the coming weeks.' Lyft is one of several companies that allow customers to use a smartphone app to book and pay for rides in a private car. It currently operates in more than 50 U.S. cities. The big pink mustaches were introduced as part of Lyft's launch effort in 2012. Makeover: About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday . However, the symbol stuck around longer than expected because it continued to create hype. More importantly, Lyft president John Zimmer said the gimmick made people smile. However, recently it was decided a makeover was needed. Jesse McMillin, the company’s new creative director, told Wired.com: 'A lot of times you’d see people driving around and [the fluffy pink mustache] was cockeyed, or matted, or windblown.' Lyft phased out the original mustaches a few months back in place of the sleeker glowstaches. Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. The app matches them with the nearest driver. Drivers attach  pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers. Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers. Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student & MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer . Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    By .

What started out as a romantic night on the town in downtown . Chicago ended in a tragedy when a man fell to his death after climbing a . smokestack of a landmark hotel on the Magnificent Mile to take pictures. The victim, 23-year-old Nicholas Wieme, was . killed Thursday morning after falling 22 feet down a scorching chimney at the . top of the InterContinental Hotel. According to firefighters, Wieme, who worked as an improv comedian, . climbed onto the dome-shaped roof of the building in the 500 block of Michigan . Avenue to take pictures at around 1am, CBS Chicago reported. He apparently climbed a ladder along a smokestack to the top . when he fell into the extremely hot shaft, resulting in severe burns throughout . his body. Wieme then became wedged in an angle of the chimney and was . able to send a text message or a voice mail to his girlfriend, asking for help. However, it was too late. It took a total of about 125 firefighters . four hours to reach the 23-year-old, which required cutting a hole in the duct . work and sliding him down, according to Fire Chief Michael Fox. ‘It turned very precarious because two feet after we made . the hole was a drop that would have went 42 floors to the basement,’ Fox told NBC Chicago.

Bad decision: Wieme and his girlfriend took an elevator to the top of the InterContinental Hotel and then accessed the roof, which is restricted to the public, via an unlocked door . Second City landmark: The iconic hotel featuring a signature domed roof is located in the 500 block of Michigan Avenue and has 42 floors . Immediately after the rescue, fire officials said Wieme was able . to communicate with them before losing consciousness, at which point he stopped . talking. The 23-year-old was rushed in critical condition to Northwestern Hospital, . where he was pronounced dead from his injuries shortly after 5am. It all started hours earlier when Wieme, a Minnesota native, . and his girlfriend, Kate Henrikson, went out for dinner and drinks at Michael . Jordan Steak House. According to officials, following the meal, the young . comedian and his date decided to photograph the view from the top of . the InterContinental Hotel next door to the restaurant. Larry Langford, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department, . told the Chicago Sun-Times that the couple were able to access the roof, which is restricted to the . public, via a door that was not bolted. Once on the roof Wieme was able to scale the smokestack . located next to a large observation deck. He thought he had stepped on a ledge, . but plummeted 22 feet before getting stuck in the spot where the chute angled . before dropping 42 floors. Rescue mission: It took 125 firefighters about four hours to reach Wieme inside the chute and extract him . Risky operation: First responders had to cut a hole into the chimney's duct work and insert wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling further down . Sources said the hotel management shut off the boiler as . soon as they were notified about Wieme’s predicament. Rescue crews responded to the hotel at 1.10am after receiving . a report about a person threatening to jump off the roof of the hotel. Firefighters later learned that a man had fallen into a chimney. ‘We had to send members from the top down on ropes to assess . his condition. The whole time we’re monitoring the situation for toxic gases,’ Chief . Fox said. Officials said while Wieme was stuck in the six-foot-wide shaft, . he was communicating with his girlfriend, either with phone calls or by . texting, and that firefighters had maintained contact with him until about 3.15am. Firefighters taking part in the rescue operation cut a hole . in the steel duct work and inserted wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling . 400 feet. They then slid him down into the opening and removed him from the . chute. Raymond Vermolen, general manager at the InterContinental, . released a statement Thursday morning: . ‘The InterContinental Magnificent Mile holds the safety, . comfort and well-being of our guests and employees as our top priority and . concern. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of . the guest at this difficult time. The hotel staff will continue to cooperate . fully with authorities in their investigation.’ Funnyman: Wieme (bottom second from the left) recently moved to Chicago from Minnesota and worked as a comedian . Promising career: Wieme had his comedy routines posted on a website and was scheduled to perform Monday at the Cabaret Theater . The Cook County medical examiner's office said Wieme . recently moved from Pipestone, Minnesota, and was living on the North Side of . Chicago. Wieme was registered with a comedy website, Rooftop . Comedy, which features videos showing the 23-year-old Minnesota State University graduate performing on stage, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He was scheduled to appear Monday at the iO Improv's Cabaret Theater. Alumni from iO Improv include such household names as Tina Fey, Mike Meyers and Andy Dick. Kyja Nelson, a professor at Minnesota State at Moorhead, described Wieme as 'very creative' and 'larger than life.' 'Everything he did, he had fun doing it. That's part of his vibrancy,' Nelson said, adding that the young man had a sharp sense of humor.

Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic last night scored the ‘greatest goal ever’ to round off a crushing victory over England in the first match at his national stadium. The talented footballer's remarkable overhead kick came when he was 30 yards from goal. He sprang six feet into the air to arch the ball over the helpless goalkeeper and into the net. The world's biggest football names are already queuing up to praise the goal, with even England's gobsmacked stars hailing his achievement as 'extraordinary' and 'world class'. Scroll down for video . Sporting beauty: Zlatan Ibrahimovic unleashes his incredible overhead kick after leaping six feet into the air to score the wonder goal that fired Sweden to a 4-2 victory over England . Remarkable talent: The crowd went silent as the ball arched over helpless England goalkeeper Joe Hart into the back of the net - and then erupted in wild applause . Game-changer: The player tears off his shirt to celebrate as the crowd on both sides cheers the incredible moment at Stockholm's new Friends Stadium . VIDEO: Watch Zlatan Ibrahimovic's incredible fourth goal... England captain Steven Gerrard, playing his 100th match for his country, said: 'It is the best goal I have seen live. 'The best goal I’d seen before that was Wayne Rooney’s against Manchester . City. 'Everyone knows how special that was, but this one — an overhead . kick from 30 yards when the ball is six feet in the air — only certain . players can do that. And he is a special player. ‘This was a world-class performance from a  world-class player.' Ibrahamivic's . goal was his fourth of the match, taking the score to 4-2 to round off . the first game at Friends Arena in Stockholm. Pure delight: Sweden's captain celebrates his outrageous fourth goal of the friendly, with the world praising the sheer audacity of his remarkable propeller kick . @rioferdy5 What a goal Ibra Rio Ferdinand . @therealstevenpiNo words can describe that goal Steven Pienaar . @RobbieSavage8Oh dear! One of best goals I’ve ever seen Robbie Savage . @themichaelowenThat was obscene. What a goal Michael Owen . PS... Zlatan enjoyed it too...‘When I saw the keeper was out of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it comes off it’s fantastic.’ The propeller kick came after goalkeeper Joe Hart had come out of his area to head the ball clear. Silence . fell as those inside the arena held their breath. and watched the . flight of the ball. Then the noise exploded as it landed in the net. Even England . supporters stood to applaud the audacity of Sweden's captain, thrilled . to witness such a brilliant flash of sporting beauty. Ibrahimovic ripped off his shirt, tossed it towards the crowd and shrugged as he was shown a yellow card. Asked to rate his international career . out of 10, Ibrahimovic replied: ‘Ten. When I saw the goalkeeper was out . of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it . comes off it’s fantastic.’ Former England manager Graham Taylor said: ‘That’s the greatest goal I’ve ever seen.’ England manager Roy Hodgson, who . suffered his first defeat over 90 minutes, said: ‘Ibrahimovic’s fourth . goal was extraordinary and it put the tin lid on the game. It was a . fantastic goal. 'But it was the second and third goals which killed us. 'For 60-70 minutes we played very well and deserved to be leading. There . are lots of reasons to be optimistic.’ Opener: Ibrahmovic fires Sweden into the lead after 20 minutes - but Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker put England ahead before half-time . Hat-trick hero: Ibrahimovic curls home a free kick to put Sweden in front again in the final 14 minutes, and his fourth goal was then the icing on the cake . Sweden's star man famously once said: 'Guardiola (then . Barcelona manager) drove me like a Fiat... I am a Ferrari.' It was a typical comment from a man who, despite his . doubters, has never been short of confidence in his own ability. And while Ibrahimovic's performances against English clubs in . Europe have often fallen short of his high standards (before last night he had . scored just four goals in 1,556 minutes against English clubs and England) his . wider statistics mark him out as one of the best players of his generation. He is the only player to have scored for six different clubs . in the Champions League, and up until last season he had won eight consecutive . league titles (Ajax 03/04, Juventus 04/05, 05/06, Inter 06/07, 0708, 08/09, Barcelona . 09/10 and AC Milan 10/11). And a number of managers and chairmen have recognised his . talent - he has cost a combined total of £150m in transfer fees. But missing from his CV is a Champions League victory and . honours at international level. Until those blanks are filled - though playing for Sweden . makes the latter unlikely - doubts about his greatness may remain. But . certainly not in his own head. Sweden substitute Tobias Sana said: . ‘It was Zlatan against children. He has been criticised in England and . this proves them all wrong.’ The Sweden player became the first footballer to hit four in a match against England. No-one had even scored a hat-trick against England since Marco van Basten in 1988. The . two England goals came after Ibrahimovic opened the scoring in the 20th . minute, with Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker taking the national side . to a half-time lead. The . excitement was abruptly cut off in the last 14 minutes, however, when . Ibrahimovic scored three more and went down in history. Overshadowed: England captain Steven Gerrard, appearing for the national side for the 100th time, jostles with Ibrahimovic on the pitch before praising the player's skill after the match . Historic moment: The Swedish press lauded Ibrahimovic as 'incredible' as the footballer covered the front pages . The debate as to whether Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goal was the . greatest ever will rage long and hard - but it is certainly up there with the . best. But here are a few other spectacular overhead kicks that are . vying alongside it to be recognised as the best ever. Rivaldo, Barcelona v Valencia, La Liga, June 17, 2001 . Barcelona went into the last game of the season needing a . win to qualify for the Champions League. With two minutes to go, the score was . 2-2, with Brazilian legend Rivaldo having scored both Barca's goals. Then as the home side poured forward the ball was again . chipped into Rivaldo as he stood on the edge of the box with his back to goal. Two touches later - one with the chest, one an acrobatic swing of the right . boot - and the ball had nestled into the bottom corner and Barca's place in the . following season's Champions League was assured. Trevor Sinclair, QPR v Barnsley, FA Cup Fourth Round, . January 25, 1997 . Ask any fan of QPR - and a large number of other supporters . - and they will tell you the greatest goal that will ever be scored came from . the right foot of Trevor Sinclair back in 1997. The flying winger met a looping cross from the right a full . 20 yards from goal with an acrobatic overhead kick that flew into the back of . the net . After the game Sinclair reported: 'I try them all the time . in training but they’ve never come off like that.' It was such a good strike that it beat David Beckham’s goal . from the halfway line against Wimbledon to be crowned Match of the Day’s Goal . of the Season. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United v Manchester City, Premier . League, February 12, 2011 . Just 13 minutes were left with a disappointing Manchester . derby poised at 1-1. Nani swung in a cross that looped up off the back of a . City defender. Waiting underneath it was Rooney, who leapt up, arched his back and . executed the perfect scissor kick into the top corner. 'I think so,' said Rooney when asked if it was the best goal . of his career. 'I saw it come into the box and thought \"why not?\" 'Thankfully it finished up in the top corner. I was trying . to get in a good position for when Nani crossed it. Nine time out of 10 they go . over the crossbar. Today it ended up in the top corner.’ Pele, Allied PoWs v Germany, Paris (from the film Escape to Victory) The Allies went 4-0 down in the first half before pulling a goal back on the stroke of half time. Pele, who the Germans had succeeded in kicking off the park, roused himself for the treatment table to help the team's cause. And it was the Brazlian superstar who completed one of the greatest sporting comebacks in cinematic history. With the score clawed back to 4-3 and the clock ticking down Pele sprayed the ball wide to Booby Moore who took it down on his chest before standing up a cross into the box. Pele, holding his damaged arm to his chest, leapt into the air swung up his right boot and made it 4-4. Cue celebrations and a sneaky escape thanks to the Parisian crowd.

Podolski celebrates his first goal since returning to Cologne, but it did not stop his side sliding to defeat. The hosts had already gone behind to a second-minute Jefferson Farfan strike when Podolski, who rejoined his boyhood club from Bayern Munich in the summer, levelled matters with six minutes played. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Farfan was alert to the opportunity and sent his flying header into the back of the net for his second of the campaign. The mood inside the RheinEnergie Stadion improved significantly four minutes later when Podolski latched onto a through-ball before coolly stepping around Manuel Neuer to stroke home. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net. Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover.</td>\n","      <td>Lukas Podolski scores his first goal since returning to Cologne in 2-1 defeat .\\nJefferson Farfan and Levan Kobiashvili scored the goals that gave Schalke win .\\nThe defeat leaves Cologne on bottom of the Bundesliga table after five games .</td>\n","      <td>ac2e59e27564f0c77b03513cdea6616d8dd8361d</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide.

Sleeker look: Lyft co-founder John Zimmer displays his company's new mascot - a 5in-long plastic replica of the original fluffy mustache which goes on the dashboard . About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday. Commenting on the haircut, a representative for Lyft said: 'The new glowstache marks an exciting moment for Lyft as we embark on the next chapter of our growth. 'We’ll begin rolling the glowstache out to Lyft drivers across the country in the coming weeks.' Lyft is one of several companies that allow customers to use a smartphone app to book and pay for rides in a private car. It currently operates in more than 50 U.S. cities. The big pink mustaches were introduced as part of Lyft's launch effort in 2012. Makeover: About 300 employees picked up the more discreet 'glowstaches' from the company's San Francisco headquarters on Monday . However, the symbol stuck around longer than expected because it continued to create hype. More importantly, Lyft president John Zimmer said the gimmick made people smile. However, recently it was decided a makeover was needed. Jesse McMillin, the company’s new creative director, told Wired.com: 'A lot of times you’d see people driving around and [the fluffy pink mustache] was cockeyed, or matted, or windblown.' Lyft phased out the original mustaches a few months back in place of the sleeker glowstaches. Lyft users open an app on their iOS or Android smartphones and signal drivers to pick them up and take them to their destinations. The app matches them with the nearest driver. Drivers attach  pink mustaches to their cars to identify themselves to passengers. Instead of using official taxi operators or limousine service drivers, Lyft recruits regular people who wish to make extra money by offering rides in their own cars in exchange for 'donations' from passengers. Some of Lyft's NYC founding drivers include a NY firefighter, a mother going back to school who runs a youth organization that revolves around teens and art, a honor student &amp; MTA maintenance worker using Lyft to help pay off loans, a school teacher and father of three sons who are all actors, and a space suit designer . Drivers are screened with criminal background checks, and they must be licensed with the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.</td>\n","      <td>The easy-to-spot decoration has been replaced with a 5in-long plastic replica which goes on the dashboard .\\nThe new mascot lights up so customers can see Lyft vehicles at night .\\nIt's hoped the makeover will give the brand a more modern look .</td>\n","      <td>e6e81a49a9d631d8a3e4292ba1810e000ce6fffa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>By .

Tragic death: Nicholas Wieme, a 23-year-old comedian from Chicago, fell to his death into a scorching smokestack after climbing the top of a landmark hotel to take pictures . What started out as a romantic night on the town in downtown . Chicago ended in a tragedy when a man fell to his death after climbing a . smokestack of a landmark hotel on the Magnificent Mile to take pictures. The victim, 23-year-old Nicholas Wieme, was . killed Thursday morning after falling 22 feet down a scorching chimney at the . top of the InterContinental Hotel. According to firefighters, Wieme, who worked as an improv comedian, . climbed onto the dome-shaped roof of the building in the 500 block of Michigan . Avenue to take pictures at around 1am, CBS Chicago reported. He apparently climbed a ladder along a smokestack to the top . when he fell into the extremely hot shaft, resulting in severe burns throughout . his body. Wieme then became wedged in an angle of the chimney and was . able to send a text message or a voice mail to his girlfriend, asking for help. However, it was too late. It took a total of about 125 firefighters . four hours to reach the 23-year-old, which required cutting a hole in the duct . work and sliding him down, according to Fire Chief Michael Fox. ‘It turned very precarious because two feet after we made . the hole was a drop that would have went 42 floors to the basement,’ Fox told NBC Chicago. Scroll down to watch video . Bad decision: Wieme and his girlfriend took an elevator to the top of the InterContinental Hotel and then accessed the roof, which is restricted to the public, via an unlocked door . Second City landmark: The iconic hotel featuring a signature domed roof is located in the 500 block of Michigan Avenue and has 42 floors . Immediately after the rescue, fire officials said Wieme was able . to communicate with them before losing consciousness, at which point he stopped . talking. The 23-year-old was rushed in critical condition to Northwestern Hospital, . where he was pronounced dead from his injuries shortly after 5am. It all started hours earlier when Wieme, a Minnesota native, . and his girlfriend, Kate Henrikson, went out for dinner and drinks at Michael . Jordan Steak House. According to officials, following the meal, the young . comedian and his date decided to photograph the view from the top of . the InterContinental Hotel next door to the restaurant. Larry Langford, a spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department, . told the Chicago Sun-Times that the couple were able to access the roof, which is restricted to the . public, via a door that was not bolted. Once on the roof Wieme was able to scale the smokestack . located next to a large observation deck. He thought he had stepped on a ledge, . but plummeted 22 feet before getting stuck in the spot where the chute angled . before dropping 42 floors. Rescue mission: It took 125 firefighters about four hours to reach Wieme inside the chute and extract him . Risky operation: First responders had to cut a hole into the chimney's duct work and insert wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling further down . Sources said the hotel management shut off the boiler as . soon as they were notified about Wieme’s predicament. Rescue crews responded to the hotel at 1.10am after receiving . a report about a person threatening to jump off the roof of the hotel. Firefighters later learned that a man had fallen into a chimney. ‘We had to send members from the top down on ropes to assess . his condition. The whole time we’re monitoring the situation for toxic gases,’ Chief . Fox said. Officials said while Wieme was stuck in the six-foot-wide shaft, . he was communicating with his girlfriend, either with phone calls or by . texting, and that firefighters had maintained contact with him until about 3.15am. Firefighters taking part in the rescue operation cut a hole . in the steel duct work and inserted wood beams to prevent Wieme from falling . 400 feet. They then slid him down into the opening and removed him from the . chute. Raymond Vermolen, general manager at the InterContinental, . released a statement Thursday morning: . ‘The InterContinental Magnificent Mile holds the safety, . comfort and well-being of our guests and employees as our top priority and . concern. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of . the guest at this difficult time. The hotel staff will continue to cooperate . fully with authorities in their investigation.’ Funnyman: Wieme (bottom second from the left) recently moved to Chicago from Minnesota and worked as a comedian . Promising career: Wieme had his comedy routines posted on a website and was scheduled to perform Monday at the Cabaret Theater . The Cook County medical examiner's office said Wieme . recently moved from Pipestone, Minnesota, and was living on the North Side of . Chicago. Wieme was registered with a comedy website, Rooftop . Comedy, which features videos showing the 23-year-old Minnesota State University graduate performing on stage, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He was scheduled to appear Monday at the iO Improv's Cabaret Theater. Alumni from iO Improv include such household names as Tina Fey, Mike Meyers and Andy Dick. Kyja Nelson, a professor at Minnesota State at Moorhead, described Wieme as 'very creative' and 'larger than life.' 'Everything he did, he had fun doing it. That's part of his vibrancy,' Nelson said, adding that the young man had a sharp sense of humor. The victim's brother, Jamie, said that it was during college that the English major first became involved in standup comedy, which eventually led him to move to Chicago and pursue a career in improv.

Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic last night scored the ‘greatest goal ever’ to round off a crushing victory over England in the first match at his national stadium. The talented footballer's remarkable overhead kick came when he was 30 yards from goal. He sprang six feet into the air to arch the ball over the helpless goalkeeper and into the net. The world's biggest football names are already queuing up to praise the goal, with even England's gobsmacked stars hailing his achievement as 'extraordinary' and 'world class'. Scroll down for video . Sporting beauty: Zlatan Ibrahimovic unleashes his incredible overhead kick after leaping six feet into the air to score the wonder goal that fired Sweden to a 4-2 victory over England . Remarkable talent: The crowd went silent as the ball arched over helpless England goalkeeper Joe Hart into the back of the net - and then erupted in wild applause . Game-changer: The player tears off his shirt to celebrate as the crowd on both sides cheers the incredible moment at Stockholm's new Friends Stadium . VIDEO: Watch Zlatan Ibrahimovic's incredible fourth goal... England captain Steven Gerrard, playing his 100th match for his country, said: 'It is the best goal I have seen live. 'The best goal I’d seen before that was Wayne Rooney’s against Manchester . City. 'Everyone knows how special that was, but this one — an overhead . kick from 30 yards when the ball is six feet in the air — only certain . players can do that. And he is a special player. ‘This was a world-class performance from a  world-class player.' Ibrahamivic's . goal was his fourth of the match, taking the score to 4-2 to round off . the first game at Friends Arena in Stockholm. Pure delight: Sweden's captain celebrates his outrageous fourth goal of the friendly, with the world praising the sheer audacity of his remarkable propeller kick . @rioferdy5 What a goal Ibra Rio Ferdinand . @therealstevenpiNo words can describe that goal Steven Pienaar . @RobbieSavage8Oh dear! One of best goals I’ve ever seen Robbie Savage . @themichaelowenThat was obscene. What a goal Michael Owen . PS... Zlatan enjoyed it too...‘When I saw the keeper was out of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it comes off it’s fantastic.’ The propeller kick came after goalkeeper Joe Hart had come out of his area to head the ball clear. Silence . fell as those inside the arena held their breath. and watched the . flight of the ball. Then the noise exploded as it landed in the net. Even England . supporters stood to applaud the audacity of Sweden's captain, thrilled . to witness such a brilliant flash of sporting beauty. Ibrahimovic ripped off his shirt, tossed it towards the crowd and shrugged as he was shown a yellow card. Asked to rate his international career . out of 10, Ibrahimovic replied: ‘Ten. When I saw the goalkeeper was out . of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it . comes off it’s fantastic.’ Former England manager Graham Taylor said: ‘That’s the greatest goal I’ve ever seen.’ England manager Roy Hodgson, who . suffered his first defeat over 90 minutes, said: ‘Ibrahimovic’s fourth . goal was extraordinary and it put the tin lid on the game. It was a . fantastic goal. 'But it was the second and third goals which killed us. 'For 60-70 minutes we played very well and deserved to be leading. There . are lots of reasons to be optimistic.’ Opener: Ibrahmovic fires Sweden into the lead after 20 minutes - but Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker put England ahead before half-time . Hat-trick hero: Ibrahimovic curls home a free kick to put Sweden in front again in the final 14 minutes, and his fourth goal was then the icing on the cake . Sweden's star man famously once said: 'Guardiola (then . Barcelona manager) drove me like a Fiat... I am a Ferrari.' It was a typical comment from a man who, despite his . doubters, has never been short of confidence in his own ability. And while Ibrahimovic's performances against English clubs in . Europe have often fallen short of his high standards (before last night he had . scored just four goals in 1,556 minutes against English clubs and England) his . wider statistics mark him out as one of the best players of his generation. He is the only player to have scored for six different clubs . in the Champions League, and up until last season he had won eight consecutive . league titles (Ajax 03/04, Juventus 04/05, 05/06, Inter 06/07, 0708, 08/09, Barcelona . 09/10 and AC Milan 10/11). And a number of managers and chairmen have recognised his . talent - he has cost a combined total of £150m in transfer fees. But missing from his CV is a Champions League victory and . honours at international level. Until those blanks are filled - though playing for Sweden . makes the latter unlikely - doubts about his greatness may remain. But . certainly not in his own head. Sweden substitute Tobias Sana said: . ‘It was Zlatan against children. He has been criticised in England and . this proves them all wrong.’ The Sweden player became the first footballer to hit four in a match against England. No-one had even scored a hat-trick against England since Marco van Basten in 1988. The . two England goals came after Ibrahimovic opened the scoring in the 20th . minute, with Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker taking the national side . to a half-time lead. The . excitement was abruptly cut off in the last 14 minutes, however, when . Ibrahimovic scored three more and went down in history. Overshadowed: England captain Steven Gerrard, appearing for the national side for the 100th time, jostles with Ibrahimovic on the pitch before praising the player's skill after the match . Historic moment: The Swedish press lauded Ibrahimovic as 'incredible' as the footballer covered the front pages . The debate as to whether Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goal was the . greatest ever will rage long and hard - but it is certainly up there with the . best. But here are a few other spectacular overhead kicks that are . vying alongside it to be recognised as the best ever. Rivaldo, Barcelona v Valencia, La Liga, June 17, 2001 . Barcelona went into the last game of the season needing a . win to qualify for the Champions League. With two minutes to go, the score was . 2-2, with Brazilian legend Rivaldo having scored both Barca's goals. Then as the home side poured forward the ball was again . chipped into Rivaldo as he stood on the edge of the box with his back to goal. Two touches later - one with the chest, one an acrobatic swing of the right . boot - and the ball had nestled into the bottom corner and Barca's place in the . following season's Champions League was assured. Trevor Sinclair, QPR v Barnsley, FA Cup Fourth Round, . January 25, 1997 . Ask any fan of QPR - and a large number of other supporters . - and they will tell you the greatest goal that will ever be scored came from . the right foot of Trevor Sinclair back in 1997. The flying winger met a looping cross from the right a full . 20 yards from goal with an acrobatic overhead kick that flew into the back of . the net . After the game Sinclair reported: 'I try them all the time . in training but they’ve never come off like that.' It was such a good strike that it beat David Beckham’s goal . from the halfway line against Wimbledon to be crowned Match of the Day’s Goal . of the Season. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United v Manchester City, Premier . League, February 12, 2011 . Just 13 minutes were left with a disappointing Manchester . derby poised at 1-1. Nani swung in a cross that looped up off the back of a . City defender. Waiting underneath it was Rooney, who leapt up, arched his back and . executed the perfect scissor kick into the top corner. 'I think so,' said Rooney when asked if it was the best goal . of his career. 'I saw it come into the box and thought \"why not?\" 'Thankfully it finished up in the top corner. I was trying . to get in a good position for when Nani crossed it. Nine time out of 10 they go . over the crossbar. Today it ended up in the top corner.’ Pele, Allied PoWs v Germany, Paris (from the film Escape to Victory) The Allies went 4-0 down in the first half before pulling a goal back on the stroke of half time. Pele, who the Germans had succeeded in kicking off the park, roused himself for the treatment table to help the team's cause. And it was the Brazlian superstar who completed one of the greatest sporting comebacks in cinematic history. With the score clawed back to 4-3 and the clock ticking down Pele sprayed the ball wide to Booby Moore who took it down on his chest before standing up a cross into the box. Pele, holding his damaged arm to his chest, leapt into the air swung up his right boot and made it 4-4. Cue celebrations and a sneaky escape thanks to the Parisian crowd.

But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape .   \n","1  Ireland clung on to claim a controversial five-run win over Zimbabwe to keep their bid to reach the World Cup quarter-finals on track. Ed Joyce's third one-day international century helped Ireland post 331 for eight - their highest ever score at a World Cup - but Zimbabwe looked like running down the record chase until a debatable John Mooney catch. Replays appeared to show Mooney had stepped on the rope when he held on to remove Sean Williams, who was four short of a century and seemingly in control of the pursuit. Alex Cusack (centre) of Ireland is congratulated by team mates after getting the wicket of Tawanda Mupariwa . Kevin O'Brien celebrates after Sean Williams is controversially caught out by John Mooney . Ireland celebrate after winning their pulsating World Cup clash against Zimbabwe and knocking them out . The third umpire was called to judge the catch, although Williams did not remain on the field of play after he instead opted to take the word of Mooney that he had taken the catch inside the rope. There was still drama to follow as number 10 Tawanda Mupariwa slapped 19 from the penultimate over, delivered by Kevin O'Brien, to leave Zimbabwe needing seven from the last six balls. But Alex Cusack held his nerve as he claimed the final two wickets, first getting Regis Chakabva to drag on before Mupariwa skied a catch William Porterfield gratefully accepted. While Joyce's 112 earned him the man-of-the-match award Cusack's four for 32 was just as invaluable, especially after he removed Zimbabwe skipper Brendon Taylor for 121. Ed Joyce celebrates making his third one-day international century and helping Ireland to 331-8 . Joyce scores many of his impressive runs as Ireland boosted their chances of World Cup qualification . Victory was Ireland's second over a full-member nation at the tournament after they opened their campaign with a win over West Indies. They will, however, most likely need to pull off one more shock in their final two pool games against India and Pakistan. Pakistan's surprise win over South Africa earlier in the day did Ireland few favours and their clash in Adelaide on March 15 looms as a potential decider. John Mooney celebrates getting the wicket of Sikandar Raza and helping them on their way to victory . Ireland stand for the national anthem during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe . Joyce became the fourth Ireland player to score a World Cup century although he was given a helping hand by a sloppy Zimbabwe fielding display. The Sussex batsman was twice dropped, while he edged his first ball just short of slip, but was otherwise imperious as he hit nine fours and three sixes. He joined in a third-wicket partnership of 138 with Andy Balbirnie, who was only three runs away from following Joyce to three figures after he was run out during the late-over scramble. Ireland took 108 from the final 10 overs to reach their highest ODI score, surpassing the 329 for seven they racked up during their famous World Cup win over England in Bangalore four years ago. Kevin O'Brien celebrates after taking the controversial wicket of  Zimbabwe batsman Sean Williams . Williams reacts after getting out at the Bellerive Oval ground despite it looking like Mooney touched the foam . When Zimbabwe then crashed to 74 for four in reply Ireland were in total control only for Taylor and Williams to turn the momentum of the match in a 149-run stand. Taylor reached his century from 79 balls and Ireland's attack was looking toothless until Cusack produced a slower ball to fool the Zimbabwe skipper into spooning a catch to mid-on. Williams kept the scoreboard ticking over and had reduced the task to a manageable 32 from 20 balls when Mooney's controversial catch was claimed. It was a critical moment and while Mupariwa made Ireland sweat, as he hit Kevin O'Brien for back-to-back fours and then a six, Cusack cleaned up the tail in a thrilling finale. The Irish players congratulate each other after their final over victory over the African country .   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Laurence Fishburne is a multimillionaire actor with roles on hit shows on both ABC and NBC and a part in the upcoming 'Superman v. Batman: Dawn of Justice.' His 80-year-old mother, meanwhile, is broke and facing eviction - and her successful son refuses to call her, she told the New York Post. 'He's gone Hollywood.  For 20 years, I funded my son’s career. He promised me he would take care of me. ... To this day, I have not got a Christmas present or a \"Thank you, Mama\" present. He hasn’t given me a penny,' Hattie Crawford Fishburne told the newspaper. Hattie Crawford Fishburn, 80, holds up her eviction notice as she claims she's being kicked out of her Los Angeles apartment - and that her son can't be bothered to pick up the phone . Laurence Fishburne's mother Hattie, pictured with her son on the red carpet in 1999, says she is facing eviction and hasn't heard from her son in over a year . She says she's living on $3,000 a month from social security and her pension from years of teaching in public schools in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. Mrs Fisburne says she's struggling to pay her medical expenses from her arthritis, underactive thyroid, high cholesterol and injuries she sustained in a massive car crash. Montana Fishburne's father reportedly stopped speaking with her she made two porn videos . She's now so far behind on the $1,500-a-month rent on her Los Angeles apartment that she's be evicted on Tuesday, she told the Post. Despite her attempts to reach her son Laurence, she hasn't spoken to him in more than a year, she says. A call to Fishburne's publicist by Daily Mail Online was not immediately returned. Fishburne, who played the iconic character of Morpheus on the 'Matrix' trilogy, is worth an estimated $20million and earns $175,000 per episode of the NBC show 'Hannibal,' according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. In addition to 'Hannibal,' the 53-year-old actor also stars in and produces ABC's 'Black-ish' and is reprising his role of Daily Planet editor Perry White in the new 'Superman v. Batman' role. In 1994, Mrs Fishburne went to the press with reports she was being evicted from her home in Brooklyn, where she had raised her son as a single mother. Laurence was a child star, appearing on state at age 10 and in soap operas by 12. At age 14, he lied his way into a role in 'Apocalypse Now' by claiming he was 18. The father-of-three has had other estrangements from his family, according to the Post. His daughter Montana says he stopped speaking to her when it emerged she was appearing in porn videos. She was last reported to be working as a stripper in Texas.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Blackpool Pier is facing an uncertain future after being put up for sale for £4.8million. The historic attraction is one of three piers which have been put on the market by owners Cuerden Leisure for a collective asking price of £12.6million. Blackpool Central Pier - home to the famous 33 metre high (108ft) Ferris wheel and the closest of three piers to Blackpool Tower - Blackpool South Pier and Llandudno Pier in Wales, were all constructed in the 19th century. Scroll down for video . Up for grabs: Blackpool Central Pier is on sale for almost £5million, along with Blackpool South Pier . But Llandudno, which is 695 metres long (2,280ft), is the only pier which is grade two listed, meaning any future owners would require Listed Building Consent to make changes to the structure. Blackpool Central Pier, which stands at 341 metres long (1,118ft), and Blackpool South Pier, which is 150 metres long (492ft), do not benefit from listed status, despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively. But Richard Baldwin, a director at Bilfinger GVA, who are selling the piers for Cuerden Leisure, said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes. He said: 'In order to sustain their value and ensure that value appreciated, they would not change dramatically under new ownership. 'In our opinion, the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the Blackpool piers.' The Victorian piers, which were constructed using cast iron piles, steel frames and wooden decking, all boast amusement arcades and rides and generate a collective income of around £1.6 million a year for Cuerden Leisure through annual concession agreements. Grade two listed: Llandudno Pier is also on sale - and altogether they can be bought for £12.6million . St John Stott, director at Cuerden Leisure - which also owns Eastbourne Pier - said the group was selling three of the four piers as it was 'restructuring its assets'. He said: 'These assets are jewels in the crown of the UK's coastline and we are delighted to offer them to the market either as separate lots or collectively.' Mr Baldwin added: 'Each of these piers are truly iconic structures, having been popular visitor attractions in two of the UK's best known resorts for over a century. 'Each pier is being offered for sale freehold, subject to the various concession agreements in place. 'As profitable attractions, we're confident this sale will attract major interest.' A spokesman for the National Piers Society, which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the UK, said: 'These piers are all in good order and trading successfully, and, given that Easter is almost upon us, I have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers.'   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Prime Minister Tony Abbott has come under fire from Irish leaders  who dubbed his St Patrick's Day video message 'patrionising'. Mr Abbott said St Patrick's Day is a 'great day for the Irish...and anyone else who wants to come to a party', and that it is the 'one day of the year when it's good to be green,' in the video posted to the Liberal Party's YouTube page. 'This is the love of  life and good humour the Irish have given Australia,' he continued. 'As you can see, I've got my green tie on for the occasion.' Tony Abbott has come under fire for his 'patronising' St Patrick's Day message . 'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs,' Mr Abbott says in the video . 'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs.' An Irish businessman in Australia said the Prime Minister's message is 'patronising', according to the Irish Times. 'I would have hoped for a more business-focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions,' he said. 'There are so many good stories of Irish people in business in Australia, Mr Abbott's lack of awareness of any of that is astonishing.' The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it. The Lansdowne Club said it was unable to find space on the day's schedule to show the 70-second video. 'I would have hoped for a more business-focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions,' an Irish businessman told the Irish Times . The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it. Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Barry Corr said the video was 'a generic St Patrick's Day message' and 'on that basis it is not part of the event'. More than 2000 people are expected to attend sold-out events at the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne and the Lansdowne Club in Sydney.

But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being.

Ed Joyce's third one-day international century helped Ireland post 331 for eight - their highest ever score at a World Cup - but Zimbabwe looked like running down the record chase until a debatable John Mooney catch.

The third umpire was called to judge the catch, although Williams did not remain on the field of play after he instead opted to take the word of Mooney that he had taken the catch inside the rope. There was still drama to follow as number 10 Tawanda Mupariwa slapped 19 from the penultimate over, delivered by Kevin O'Brien, to leave Zimbabwe needing seven from the last six balls. But Alex Cusack held his nerve as he claimed the final two wickets, first getting Regis Chakabva to drag on before Mupariwa skied a catch William Porterfield gratefully accepted. While Joyce's 112 earned him the man-of-the-match award Cusack's four for 32 was just as invaluable, especially after he removed Zimbabwe skipper Brendon Taylor for 121. Ed Joyce celebrates making his third one-day international century and helping Ireland to 331-8 . Joyce scores many of his impressive runs as Ireland boosted their chances of World Cup qualification . Victory was Ireland's second over a full-member nation at the tournament after they opened their campaign with a win over West Indies. They will, however, most likely need to pull off one more shock in their final two pool games against India and Pakistan. Pakistan's surprise win over South Africa earlier in the day did Ireland few favours and their clash in Adelaide on March 15 looms as a potential decider. John Mooney celebrates getting the wicket of Sikandar Raza and helping them on their way to victory . Ireland stand for the national anthem during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe . Joyce became the fourth Ireland player to score a World Cup century although he was given a helping hand by a sloppy Zimbabwe fielding display. The Sussex batsman was twice dropped, while he edged his first ball just short of slip, but was otherwise imperious as he hit nine fours and three sixes. He joined in a third-wicket partnership of 138 with Andy Balbirnie, who was only three runs away from following Joyce to three figures after he was run out during the late-over scramble. Ireland took 108 from the final 10 overs to reach their highest ODI score, surpassing the 329 for seven they racked up during their famous World Cup win over England in Bangalore four years ago. Kevin O'Brien celebrates after taking the controversial wicket of  Zimbabwe batsman Sean Williams . Williams reacts after getting out at the Bellerive Oval ground despite it looking like Mooney touched the foam . When Zimbabwe then crashed to 74 for four in reply Ireland were in total control only for Taylor and Williams to turn the momentum of the match in a 149-run stand. Taylor reached his century from 79 balls and Ireland's attack was looking toothless until Cusack produced a slower ball to fool the Zimbabwe skipper into spooning a catch to mid-on. Williams kept the scoreboard ticking over and had reduced the task to a manageable 32 from 20 balls when Mooney's controversial catch was claimed. It was a critical moment and while Mupariwa made Ireland sweat, as he hit Kevin O'Brien for back-to-back fours and then a six, Cusack cleaned up the tail in a thrilling finale.

'He's gone Hollywood.  For 20 years, I funded my son’s career. He promised me he would take care of me. ... To this day, I have not got a Christmas present or a \"Thank you, Mama\" present. He hasn’t given me a penny,' Hattie Crawford Fishburne told the newspaper. Hattie Crawford Fishburn, 80, holds up her eviction notice as she claims she's being kicked out of her Los Angeles apartment - and that her son can't be bothered to pick up the phone . Laurence Fishburne's mother Hattie, pictured with her son on the red carpet in 1999, says she is facing eviction and hasn't heard from her son in over a year . She says she's living on $3,000 a month from social security and her pension from years of teaching in public schools in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. Mrs Fisburne says she's struggling to pay her medical expenses from her arthritis, underactive thyroid, high cholesterol and injuries she sustained in a massive car crash. Montana Fishburne's father reportedly stopped speaking with her she made two porn videos . She's now so far behind on the $1,500-a-month rent on her Los Angeles apartment that she's be evicted on Tuesday, she told the Post. Despite her attempts to reach her son Laurence, she hasn't spoken to him in more than a year, she says. A call to Fishburne's publicist by Daily Mail Online was not immediately returned. Fishburne, who played the iconic character of Morpheus on the 'Matrix' trilogy, is worth an estimated $20million and earns $175,000 per episode of the NBC show 'Hannibal,' according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. In addition to 'Hannibal,' the 53-year-old actor also stars in and produces ABC's 'Black-ish' and is reprising his role of Daily Planet editor Perry White in the new 'Superman v. Batman' role. In 1994, Mrs Fishburne went to the press with reports she was being evicted from her home in Brooklyn, where she had raised her son as a single mother. Laurence was a child star, appearing on state at age 10 and in soap operas by 12. At age 14, he lied his way into a role in 'Apocalypse Now' by claiming he was 18. The father-of-three has had other estrangements from his family, according to the Post. His daughter Montana says he stopped speaking to her when it emerged she was appearing in porn videos.

The historic attraction is one of three piers which have been put on the market by owners Cuerden Leisure for a collective asking price of £12.6million. Blackpool Central Pier - home to the famous 33 metre high (108ft) Ferris wheel and the closest of three piers to Blackpool Tower - Blackpool South Pier and Llandudno Pier in Wales, were all constructed in the 19th century. Scroll down for video . Up for grabs: Blackpool Central Pier is on sale for almost £5million, along with Blackpool South Pier . But Llandudno, which is 695 metres long (2,280ft), is the only pier which is grade two listed, meaning any future owners would require Listed Building Consent to make changes to the structure. Blackpool Central Pier, which stands at 341 metres long (1,118ft), and Blackpool South Pier, which is 150 metres long (492ft), do not benefit from listed status, despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively. But Richard Baldwin, a director at Bilfinger GVA, who are selling the piers for Cuerden Leisure, said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes. He said: 'In order to sustain their value and ensure that value appreciated, they would not change dramatically under new ownership. 'In our opinion, the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the Blackpool piers.' The Victorian piers, which were constructed using cast iron piles, steel frames and wooden decking, all boast amusement arcades and rides and generate a collective income of around £1.6 million a year for Cuerden Leisure through annual concession agreements. Grade two listed: Llandudno Pier is also on sale - and altogether they can be bought for £12.6million . St John Stott, director at Cuerden Leisure - which also owns Eastbourne Pier - said the group was selling three of the four piers as it was 'restructuring its assets'. He said: 'These assets are jewels in the crown of the UK's coastline and we are delighted to offer them to the market either as separate lots or collectively.' Mr Baldwin added: 'Each of these piers are truly iconic structures, having been popular visitor attractions in two of the UK's best known resorts for over a century. 'Each pier is being offered for sale freehold, subject to the various concession agreements in place. 'As profitable attractions, we're confident this sale will attract major interest.' A spokesman for the National Piers Society, which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the UK, said: 'These piers are all in good order and trading successfully, and, given that Easter is almost upon us, I have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers.'</td>\n","      <td>Famous 341 metre landmark is being sold along with Blackpool South Pier .\\nGrade two listed Llandudno Pier has also been put on sale by owners .\\nThree 19th century piers have a collective asking price of £12.6million .</td>\n","      <td>be20bcd725584cb340615d9bb65c839657c62dd9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Prime Minister Tony Abbott has come under fire from Irish leaders  who dubbed his St Patrick's Day video message 'patrionising'.

United has been a frustrating one and admits he doesn't know what he would do if he scored against boyhood club Chelsea on Saturday. Shaw joined United last summer in a £31.5million transfer from Southampton after an impressive campaign on the south coast, which resulted in him playing for England at the World Cup. However, injuries have plagued the 19-year-old's start to life at Old Trafford with the defender picking up his latest fitness setback during United's 2-1 FA Cup sixth-round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Luke Shaw admits he has endured a 'frustrating' debut season at Manchester United giving himself a 'C-' The 19-year-old's campaign has been beset by injuries since joining from Southampton last summer . Shaw (second left) is back  training with United after missing their last five Premier League games . In total, Shaw has only made 17 appearances in all competitions - a figure he admits is less than satisfactory. “It’s been a frustrating one because of the injuries I’ve picked up but I’m loving it,' he told Match of the Day magazine in an exclusive interview. 'If I was to write a school report on my first season here I’d give myself a C-. You don’t realise just how big Man United is until you’re actually here – it’s frightening! It is the biggest club around.' Despite an injury-plagued beginning under Louis van Gaal, when fit Shaw describes himself as 'lucky' to be playing alongside players such as captain Wayne Rooney and record-signing Angel di Maria.

Shaw last appearance for United came in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month . Shaw was speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine - on sale between April 14-20 . 'I’m playing with the likes of Wayne Rooney, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao and it’s weird because my friends always talk about them, saying how good they are and I’m just thinking “Wow, I play with them!” I’m probably one of the luckiest 19-year-olds to be alive,' he added. Shaw missed United's 4-2 demolition of Manchester City on Sunday as he continues to recover from the injury picked up on FA Cup duty against Arsenal. United's No 3 was back in training prior to the Manchester derby as the Red Devils moved four points clear of their rivals in third place in the Premier League. Van Gaal's men are now looking to record their seventh league win in a row when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday evening. And Shaw, who grew up supporting Chelsea, is hoping to play a part in that fixture - adding that it is his favourite away ground to play at. 'I used to watch Chelsea every week. It was really good when I got to play at Stamford Bridge, I would say that’s my favourite away stadium to go to. Chelsea is one of the first games I look for when the new fixtures come out. 'I haven’t scored yet so I don’t know. If my first goal was to come against Chelsea I’m not sure what I’d do.' Shaw is relishing the prospect of facing boyhood club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening .

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.   \n","2

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days . After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

But more than 20 years later the once rosy-cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become Britain's fattest man. Consuming 10,000 calories-a-day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread, the 32-year-old is too heavy to walk or wash himself. He is confined to the ground floor flat where he lives alone in Dover, Kent, kept company by a team of NHS carers who come to bathe him and cook for him every day. Scroll down for video . Carl Thompson, 32, has gained an astonishing 30 stone in just three years and is now bed-bound at 65 stone . Mr Thompson said he has always had problems with food and was even caught raiding neighbours fridges when he was three (left). But aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child . Living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance, Mr Thompson spends roughly £200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping. He has not had a job since he was 17 when he worked in a food factory. At the time Mr Thompson said he ate everything the factory didn't sell. But after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour, Mr Thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief. Breakfast: Four sausages, five fried eggs, fried bread, mushrooms fried in butter, bowl of cereal with full fat milk . Lunch: Bowl of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate . Dinner: Chinese or Indian takeaway of up to £25 five nights a week . Snacks: £10 a day on Yorkie bars . With food as his only source of comfort, he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound. 'That’s how I put all this weight on. I was very close to my mum,' he said speaking of his mother. 'She was fantastic, and I still haven’t got over it.' Now his days normally begin with a fry-up breakfast of four sausages, five fried eggs, a pan-full of mushrooms and fried bread. Lunch can be a bowlful of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate and dinner a takeaway. Since he is unable to leave the house Mr Thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways. His carers prepare meals with the ingredients he has bought. 'I order takeaways five nights a week, usually spending between £10 and £25 on Chinese, curries, pizza or fish and chips,' he said. 'My carers cook my food during he day and it's always microwaved meals - my favourite is chicken curry.' Alongside takeaways Mr Thompson spends £10 a day on chocolate, typically Yorkie bars. Mr Thompson has put on 30 stone since 2012 (pictured above) when his mother died . He has not had a relationship since his early twenties which ended because of his weight gain. 'My last girlfriend was a girl called Rachel 10 years ago, but we split up after three years because of my weight,' he said. While Mr Thompson said he has always had a problem with food (he was caught raiding his neighbours' fridges when he was three) he said it was made worse by the death of his mother in 2012. Having been admitted to hospital for heart attacks and septicemia in the last three years, he is facing death unless he drastically changes his diet. Desperate to shed 45 stone, Mr Thompson said: 'I could die, that’s the bottom line if I keep going the way I do. 'Because of what I eat I’m missing out on everything in life. 'I cannot go to the park and I cannot go on holiday.' But unlike Paul Mason, previously Britain's heaviest man who tipped the scales at 70 stone, Mr Thompson said he does not want to undergo gastric band surgery. 'I need to go somewhere to lose my weight naturally because I can’t do it on my own,' he said. 'I don’t want a gastric band, they’re dangerous. I’d like the help of a dietician and a psychiatrist to help shift the weight.” While Mr Thompson said he has always had weight issues, he ballooned in size following the death of his mother (pictured together left when he was 15). Now he cannot wash or leave the house . The former factory worker said he has always had a problem with food. He is pictured above aged around four . 'I will go anywhere which will help me lose weight. It’s taken over my life. I can’t move, I can’t cook, and it’s time for that to end.' Earlier this week a woman weighing 60 stone who was once Britain's fattest teenager had to be airlifted out of her home. Georgia Davis, 22, was taken to hospital following the dramatic effort which using a crane to get her out of her specially adapted flat in Aberdare, south Wales. Paul Mason, who was once considered the fattest man in the country after ballooning to 70 stone, has recently told of his ordeal trying to get rid of excess skin following a 46-stone weight loss. The 54-year-old travelled to the U.S. to have the operation carried out after being refused by the NHS. Mr Thompson eats 10,000 calories a day between takeaways, fry up breakfasts, pork pies and microwavable meals . The 32-year-old said he is desperate to lose weight but does not want a gastric band because he thinks they are dangerous .   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                highlights  \\\n","0                         Luke Shaw has made just 17 appearances for Manchester United .\\nShaw joined  United from Southampton last summer .\\nThe 19-year-old's start at Old Trafford has been beset by injury problems .\\nUnited travel to Premier League leaders Chelsea on Saturday evening .\\nLuke Shaw: United players pranked Ashley Young after bird poo incident .   \n","1                                                        Our houses are overtaken with dust mites, leading to winter illnesses .\\nWe shed 50g every week in dead skin, mostly in our bed .\\nDust mites feed off dead human and animal skin and multiply .\\nThey leave Australians with cold or flu-like symptoms .\\nScientists recommend a weekly wash of our bed sheets .   \n","2                                                                     Wayne Rooney is set to appear on Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway .\\nThe England captain jokes around in interview with Little Ant and Dec .\\nManchester United forward admits that public attention can get annoying .\\nThe programme and interview will be aired on Saturday night from 7pm .   \n","3                                                                                                                                                             Father: \"I know he went through what he went through\"\\nLouis Jordan was found on his sailboat, which was listing and in bad shape, rescuer says .\\nHe appears to be in good shape, physically and mentally .   \n","4  Carl Thompson has put on an astonishing 30 stone in just three years .\\nWhile having always loved food his weight doubled when in 2012 .\\nThe 32-year-old credits the death of his mother with his huge weight gain .\\nGorges on takeaways five nights a week and blows £10 a day on chocolate .\\nMr Thompson is now desperate to shed 45 stone after health warnings .   \n","\n","                                         id  \n","0  450f021f46f61a71603748dacc073269052466d3  \n","1  70d9d7870cbcd0040db12628b3b5e73707e521fa  \n","2  656f43d5890e147dbc6fef1d96e033e142bd5a34  \n","3  ffff11a2f44d731cd80c86819a89b7e227581415  \n","4  7b6e3ef78add5d966f5421619401310fb100e613  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-70737fb4-41e8-4cb6-bff9-34e1357e5c3f\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>article</th>\n","      <th>highlights</th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Luke Shaw has conceded his debut season at Manchester United has been a frustrating one and admits he doesn't know what he would do if he scored against boyhood club Chelsea on Saturday. Shaw joined United last summer in a £31.5million transfer from Southampton after an impressive campaign on the south coast, which resulted in him playing for England at the World Cup. However, injuries have plagued the 19-year-old's start to life at Old Trafford with the defender picking up his latest fitness setback during United's 2-1 FA Cup sixth-round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Luke Shaw admits he has endured a 'frustrating' debut season at Manchester United giving himself a 'C-' The 19-year-old's campaign has been beset by injuries since joining from Southampton last summer . Shaw (second left) is back  training with United after missing their last five Premier League games . In total, Shaw has only made 17 appearances in all competitions - a figure he admits is less than satisfactory. “It’s been a frustrating one because of the injuries I’ve picked up but I’m loving it,' he told Match of the Day magazine in an exclusive interview. 'If I was to write a school report on my first season here I’d give myself a C-. You don’t realise just how big Man United is until you’re actually here – it’s frightening! It is the biggest club around.' Despite an injury-plagued beginning under Louis van Gaal, when fit Shaw describes himself as 'lucky' to be playing alongside players such as captain Wayne Rooney and record-signing Angel di Maria. Shaw (right) has made only made 17 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils at present . Shaw last appearance for United came in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month . Shaw was speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine - on sale between April 14-20 . 'I’m playing with the likes of Wayne Rooney, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao and it’s weird because my friends always talk about them, saying how good they are and I’m just thinking “Wow, I play with them!” I’m probably one of the luckiest 19-year-olds to be alive,' he added. Shaw missed United's 4-2 demolition of Manchester City on Sunday as he continues to recover from the injury picked up on FA Cup duty against Arsenal. United's No 3 was back in training prior to the Manchester derby as the Red Devils moved four points clear of their rivals in third place in the Premier League. Van Gaal's men are now looking to record their seventh league win in a row when they travel to table-toppers Chelsea on Saturday evening. And Shaw, who grew up supporting Chelsea, is hoping to play a part in that fixture - adding that it is his favourite away ground to play at. 'I used to watch Chelsea every week. It was really good when I got to play at Stamford Bridge, I would say that’s my favourite away stadium to go to. Chelsea is one of the first games I look for when the new fixtures come out. 'I haven’t scored yet so I don’t know. If my first goal was to come against Chelsea I’m not sure what I’d do.'

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled 1,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits, indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there’s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you’re allergic to dust mites you basically can’t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings’ or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body’s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They’re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that’s not why you’re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It’s because your dog’s hair has allergens on it – left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too – forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.</td>\n","      <td>Our houses are overtaken with dust mites, leading to winter illnesses .\\nWe shed 50g every week in dead skin, mostly in our bed .\\nDust mites feed off dead human and animal skin and multiply .\\nThey leave Australians with cold or flu-like symptoms .\\nScientists recommend a weekly wash of our bed sheets .</td>\n","      <td>70d9d7870cbcd0040db12628b3b5e73707e521fa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has revealed he gets annoyed when fans chant his name at him in the street in an interview with Ant and Dec's 'little' counterparts on Saturday Night Takeaway.

Wayne Rooney has been interviews by Little Ant and Dec for ITV's Saturday Night Takeaway programme . The England captain enjoyed a kick-around with Neil Overend and Hayden Reid, Ant and Dec's 'littles' Rooney admitted that he can find it a little tiresome to have supporters chanting his name in the streets . Rooney is asked by Little Dec: 'Does it get annoying when people say \"Rooney, Rooney, Rooney\"?' 'It's great when people say it in the stands,' the United captain says. 'But if I'm in the street and people are doing it then it is annoying.' The pair, aged eight and seven and wearing full Newcastle United kits, then chant Rooney's name at him and the 29-year-old jokes: 'Just like this! That's the annoying part!' The light-hearted chat sees Rooney get ambushed on the floor by Little Ant and Dec mid-interview .

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days . After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina &amp; RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

But more than 20 years later the once rosy-cheeked boy is facing death after ballooning to 65 stone to become Britain's fattest man. Consuming 10,000 calories-a-day by gorging on takeaways and whole loaves of bread, the 32-year-old is too heavy to walk or wash himself. He is confined to the ground floor flat where he lives alone in Dover, Kent, kept company by a team of NHS carers who come to bathe him and cook for him every day. Scroll down for video . Carl Thompson, 32, has gained an astonishing 30 stone in just three years and is now bed-bound at 65 stone . Mr Thompson said he has always had problems with food and was even caught raiding neighbours fridges when he was three (left). But aged around 10 he was a normal size and played like a normal child . Living off a combination of incapacity benefits and a disability allowance, Mr Thompson spends roughly £200 every week on takeaways and online food shopping. He has not had a job since he was 17 when he worked in a food factory. At the time Mr Thompson said he ate everything the factory didn't sell. But after the death of his mother in 2012 from a brain tumour, Mr Thompson turned to food as a means of coping with his grief. Breakfast: Four sausages, five fried eggs, fried bread, mushrooms fried in butter, bowl of cereal with full fat milk . Lunch: Bowl of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate . Dinner: Chinese or Indian takeaway of up to £25 five nights a week . Snacks: £10 a day on Yorkie bars . With food as his only source of comfort, he doubled in weight from 30 to 65 stone in just three years and became housebound. 'That’s how I put all this weight on. I was very close to my mum,' he said speaking of his mother. 'She was fantastic, and I still haven’t got over it.' Now his days normally begin with a fry-up breakfast of four sausages, five fried eggs, a pan-full of mushrooms and fried bread. Lunch can be a bowlful of pasta, chips, bacon, pork pies, crisps, pasties, sandwiches and chocolate and dinner a takeaway. Since he is unable to leave the house Mr Thompson relies on online shopping deliveries and takeaways. His carers prepare meals with the ingredients he has bought. 'I order takeaways five nights a week, usually spending between £10 and £25 on Chinese, curries, pizza or fish and chips,' he said. 'My carers cook my food during he day and it's always microwaved meals - my favourite is chicken curry.' Alongside takeaways Mr Thompson spends £10 a day on chocolate, typically Yorkie bars. Mr Thompson has put on 30 stone since 2012 (pictured above) when his mother died . He has not had a relationship since his early twenties which ended because of his weight gain. 'My last girlfriend was a girl called Rachel 10 years ago, but we split up after three years because of my weight,' he said. While Mr Thompson said he has always had a problem with food (he was caught raiding his neighbours' fridges when he was three) he said it was made worse by the death of his mother in 2012. Having been admitted to hospital for heart attacks and septicemia in the last three years, he is facing death unless he drastically changes his diet. Desperate to shed 45 stone, Mr Thompson said: 'I could die, that’s the bottom line if I keep going the way I do. 'Because of what I eat I’m missing out on everything in life. 'I cannot go to the park and I cannot go on holiday.' But unlike Paul Mason, previously Britain's heaviest man who tipped the scales at 70 stone, Mr Thompson said he does not want to undergo gastric band surgery. 'I need to go somewhere to lose my weight naturally because I can’t do it on my own,' he said. 'I don’t want a gastric band, they’re dangerous. I’d like the help of a dietician and a psychiatrist to help shift the weight.” While Mr Thompson said he has always had weight issues, he ballooned in size following the death of his mother (pictured together left when he was 15). Now he cannot wash or leave the house . The former factory worker said he has always had a problem with food. He is pictured above aged around four . 'I will go anywhere which will help me lose weight. It’s taken over my life. I can’t move, I can’t cook, and it’s time for that to end.' Earlier this week a woman weighing 60 stone who was once Britain's fattest teenager had to be airlifted out of her home. Georgia Davis, 22, was taken to hospital following the dramatic effort which using a crane to get her out of her specially adapted flat in Aberdare, south Wales. Paul Mason, who was once considered the fattest man in the country after ballooning to 70 stone, has recently told of his ordeal trying to get rid of excess skin following a 46-stone weight loss. The 54-year-old travelled to the U.S. to have the operation carried out after being refused by the NHS. Mr Thompson eats 10,000 calories a day between takeaways, fry up breakfasts, pork pies and microwavable meals . The 32-year-old said he is desperate to lose weight but does not want a gastric band because he thinks they are dangerous .</td>\n","      <td>Carl Thompson has put on an astonishing 30 stone in just three years .\\nWhile having always loved food his weight doubled when in 2012 .\\nThe 32-year-old credits the death of his mother with his huge weight gain .\\nGorges on takeaways five nights a week and blows £10 a day on chocolate .\\nMr Thompson is now desperate to shed 45 stone after health warnings .</td>\n","      <td>7b6e3ef78add5d966f5421619401310fb100e613</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-70737fb4-41e8-4cb6-bff9-34e1357e5c3f')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-70737fb4-41e8-4cb6-bff9-34e1357e5c3f button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
