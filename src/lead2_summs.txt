(1dba634e0daaeca708214dc8a9c882b6fe90538e) The official word from Arsenal is that Jack Wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season. Not to Manchester City, not to anyone.
(8c8a50ea3fd525bbd95f9e67df2ea59d74eee293) It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. Italians embrace the Cricket World Cup (yes, really), a Neville takes charge of England and it's not looking good for the Rickies.
(3cc7708043cf663433be19d565f3420cba67278f) It's Hot or Not time again as IAN LADYMAN reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. HOT .
(2921080a41634e92825238311cc29e7d8a6a6c04) It was just after breakfast, only a few short hours after the rampant champagne-fuelled celebrations into the early morning had ended, but Carlo Ancelotti knew exactly what he was saying. Still in Madrid’s five-star Tivoli Lisboa hotel, the ‘fat boy with the bowl full of Emilian tortellini’ (his own words, not mine) told an Italian journalist friend: ‘Yes we’ve made history by winning La Decima — but this is Real Madrid.
(b6907f2614e626eab5ef81c0dae5dd87df860fa7) There is a passage in Diego Torres’s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea’s manager. In the English version of Torres’s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later.
(6a3c00704e261f443009efa9dcdb07de6afcb3d1) ‘Everybody loves Harry’ exclaimed a disgruntled Ian Wright, at the very thought of anything to the contrary. ‘What you on about?’ Alongside Wrighty, Steve McManaman also defended his honour.
(c5c0fc620583264cf9eaa3dbd7f3953b9bfd1dec) Over the years I’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers, including two former world No 1's in Lorena Ochoa and Laura Davies. But none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with Charley Hull, the best teenage golfer in Britain.
(44619d2cc0127e5d3a18cb58326d06fd54cb0576) In telly terms, the FA Cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a 'journey’ this season. This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene.
(e2a44a3e3edd44c394ad6ff7207980f7f1e9b4b3) One can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the European Tour's headquarters at Wentworth last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new Masters champion, Jordan Spieth. Shortly after being presented with the green jacket, the man who has rapidly become everyone's favourite Texan flew to New York and gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours.
(5e5d2c91c7f2abb45ed296c35d2d13ddeab48e48) Read Madrid galactico Gareth Bale will be the subject of a three-way £75million transfer battle between Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City this summer. Bale has indicated, publicly at least, that he wants to stay at Real.
(e33afe5e06887172ff1eeeb279b994d4011f2a41) 'You're getting the hang of this commentary lark,' cooed Martin Tyler during Sky Sports coverage of the Manchester derby. Tyler was, of course, one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch.
(b17c798de31aa1244b6b794a4e9a96ea1cbae8c5) Sporting America fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura. The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed.
(8c3ee434db3b76a4c3fced110c61fb45cc2967c8) The potential domestic auction for Liverpool's Raheem Sterling this summer could decide which of Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United lure Gareth Bale from Real Madrid. As first revealed in Football Grapevine last month, Liverpool have put a £50million price tag on Sterling if they opt to sell the 20-year-old.
(e1863addf57a95ce8b527ca477044379fc8fe876) It is probably fair to say that never before in the history of the Masters has a crowd 10 deep assembled around the first tee at 4.20pm on the first official day of practice. Normally by then the estimated 70,000 crowd are streaming happily to the exits, savouring the day they saw Amen Corner in the flesh and clutching large shopping bags containing millions of dollars-worth of precious Masters merchandise.
(009ed61d0ae530410e72112c7f172109aecc26e7) Raheem Sterling could force his way out of Liverpool this summer, costing the club up to £25million while saving potential suitors such as Manchester City and Chelsea the same amount. Under Premier League regulations the 20-year-old is entitled to 'buy-out' the last year of  his current contract which runs out in 2017.
(21553034a4ee0df34d93caac4dafe2220e41d62c) What we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of Nico Rosberg as a racing driver. His reaction to losing to Lewis Hamilton – blaming the Brit for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel closed on him – told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of Hamilton.
(e738321378f0cf12a7ceff643d90533f3ab1068a) So it seems you are either with me or firmly against me: there doesn’t appear to be a middle ground after my comments about Tim Krul. It is a week since I criticised Newcastle United’s goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate Jermain Defoe at half-time during the Wear-Tyne derby after the Sunderland striker beat him with a brilliant volley.
(e314cc9a7bb35fe8cfdbb4b9af410d65e2215bdf) Don't be fooled, Arsene. Don’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year.
(3121fbac9a6baecb2f38fd477e63c3080684963c) So who will be voted PFA Player of the Year? Eden Hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank.
(cb963fc5bd2051872caa896465a475fc530c684e) I couldn’t wait to get out of Bournemouth, even though I loved the place. It was a holiday town, a place that would send you to sleep rather than drive you forward.
(d02bc8e213f3177936a970d93f4bf5afe0357aef) On February 14, 1998, new kid on the block Michael Owen scored a hat-trick for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. Doing so on the most romantic day of the year was fitting for the division's newest heartthrob.
(5a13f25d4bb68e27b681fe1c966478c55869f62c) Dutch football made a killing in the stock market this week. Yet its rise was not because PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title since 2008, ending Ajax's four-year reign.
(cc9bee27c90f1610b42d02d1d418cf94076d8dcb) Manchester United had four different scorers On Sunday. At the start of the season I don’t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team, let alone scoring vital goals in a huge Manchester derby.
(6cd63316e59b31c4b4814caa74e5905750a11f51) Aston Villa deserved their victory at Wembley on Sunday and there were two players at the heart of it all. Jack Grealish was fantastic but Fabian Delph was the best player on the pitch.
(f5be15e629c299b1dc62aa519efd8152869734d1) After a weekend when special goals were the norm in the Premier League, it's not an easy task to pick the best of the bunch. From Jermain Defoe's match-winning volley in the Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday, to Charlie Adam's audacious long-range effort against Chelsea on Saturday evening, there's plenty to choose from.
(da39f68c5d9a413e0759fc6bff8260f76ed1ac59) Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with his latest column for Sportsmail. The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season.
(a1f439363b64392f9644d18b2f0a426d223e27a8) It's been a frustrating few weeks but at our end we are trying everything we can to make the fight that everyone in this country wants to see – Scott Quigg against Carl Frampton. You'll have seen by now that we have offered Frampton £1.5million for the fight – all he has to do is turn up, we will take all the risks.
(dddf1bf72d84db0ae35eaa69a6c968e35808557d) Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides' last chance to win any silverware this season.

(7c9c9fd7a449360b15b0db6c3d2e323b4c3a0f91) On Friday night I’ll be wearing Bath’s No 6 shirt for the second time in a Premiership game. The switch from midfield has worked for myself and the team, so I’m hoping I can carry on playing in the back row for the rest of this season.
(96d4b439dab5b7b2c3f61f35ed07a232e85c5fdf) Tuesday night against Italy could be the most important England game Michael Carrick has ever played. The difference between the first and the second half was like night and day.
(f4848b30f489e83d5dcf827df6a587c95e9bd9ef) There’s no doubt that Mesut Ozil is an easy target for ex-pros and pundits. But when he’s at his best he is worth paying to watch.
(ba9dc0f9cff348e3cc36262a0b05aa5a3f7b0b07) I spoke to Carl Froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next. Needless to say, we were disappointed to see Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lose at the weekend against Andrzej Fonfara.
(7e1459e3b01eec19df0730b46f51535943172633) The 'campaign' continues against Chelsea when it comes to penalties – although in a first half with four penalty appeals it was clear that referee, Michael Oliver was only going to award what he felt was a stonewall spot kick and there was only one of those. The Blues had a good shout for an early penalty when Oscar was clipped by Bellerin but I agreed with Oliver that the contact was accidental and minimal - a penalty would have been very harsh.
(c5dcaf5c23ff823fc9ab67eed14d82cdcf77bddb) Richie Benaud made commentary look easy. Believe me, it isn’t.
(c817b575791dc71db2b11acbf11ccf38b15039ca) UEFA has opened a real can of worms by ordering the final 18 seconds of the European Women's Under 19 Championship qualifier between England and Norway to be replayed following a refereeing error. However, FIFA did something similar during a 2006 World Cup qualifier.
(1fd27828a16f1a0616de6ffc340ac4a74f95ed81) Scott Dann was a fraction offside when he set up Glenn Murray for Palace’s first goal (2), but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant John Brooks. He was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before Dann got the ball (1) and for Murray’s finish (3).
(d521c95a08b12492e4d49337c5f46db3bb9aae86) Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas. It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react.
(97fabfade9d3de049e2091a0ae1e80d2cadedd99) It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus.
(2d149b821ea238b5c0166b94a5334e5687388aef) All eyes will be on AP McCoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but I have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him. The 19-time champion jockey could have ridden Cause of Causes who, like his mount Shutthefrontdoor, is owned by his boss JP McManus.
(0c90d4419b30ceec838eff2fe4654781e86485f4) In a week where people have been highlighting the lack of young English talent in the Premier League, it’s good to see three youngsters playing in my old position have really caught the eye this season. Calum Chambers, Eric Dier and John Stones have all enjoyed excellent Premier League campaigns.

(7e70e49b4a22251bbd930c7390a03398b6efe28a) The title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning. At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety.
(a526b5d4016c5f16ef373c27cf160ed607a3c1ec) When Ulster confirmed the audacious signing of All Black wing Charles Piutau this week, the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from New Zealand. ‘I’m extremely disappointed he’s going,’ said Steve Hansen, coach of the world champions, having learned that the 23-year-old had rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast, in 2016-17.
(bdb4c873eb138959a9d510fa4f768c44574cf2f8) AP McCoy stood with the trainer, Jonjo O’Neill, in the parade ring. He tried to talk but his mind was elsewhere.

The Gunners' slim hopes of overhauling Chelsea's 10-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League were all but extinguished following a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
(6b3f5e04519903ba5c77ccccf9f0da2d646c9053) Francis Coquelin has jumped to the defence of team-mate Olivier Giroud following Thierry Henry's claim that Arsenal need a 'top quality striker' to win the Premier League next season.

(a3755acb1e05296a0b4882dbe7b755fd46059b3a) Mario Gomez's predatory instincts and a late goal by substitute Juan Vargas ensured Fiorentina qualified for the Europa League semi-finals.

(efdda37a28b778f2c3b255ae488682b2eb4090a0) Doctors have called for under-fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight. The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside.

(dec77c4f25aab92d67be95bbcb28b59e4aeb9f6b) Landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near-vertical rock face in Bolivia.
